Hi <First Name>,

I’m Pete Davis, a community organizer for OurCommonPlace Lexington, a new and exciting community-building initiative here in town.  If you are available, I would love to have a phone call with you in the coming week to discuss the initiative and how <organization> can get involved.

OurCommonPlace is a national organization that aims to revitalize the spirit of local community engagement in towns and cities across the country.  We recently launched www.Lexington.OurCommonPlace.com — Lexington’s first community web platform – to create a ‘common place’ online that makes it delightfully easy for neighbors and local leaders to share community information, like needs, announcements, and events, with the people around them.  Knowing that it takes more than a website to deepen community spirit, we also started the Lexington Civic Heroes program to spotlight and network civic leaders in Lexington, share great initiatives in town with Lexington residents, and build a base for future initiatives.

We want to make sure that you and <<ORGANIZATION>> are included in the OurCommonPlace Lexington initiative: in the Lexington.OurCommonPlace.com platform, in the spotlighting effort of Lexington Civic Heroes at www.LexingtonCivicHeroes.com, and in the network of Lexington leaders.  <b>Would you be available for a phone call this week to discuss?  We would love to learn about <<ORGANIZATION>> and share more about OurCommonPlace and our efforts in Lexington.</b>

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Pete Davis

Dear <<FIRSTNAME>>,
 
I’m so glad you want to become more involved with OurCommonPlace Lexington!  We’re excited to engage with as many neighbors as possible to make sure this civic tool is rewarding for everyone.  After all, the more people who access this virtual “town bulletin board,” the more effective it will be for getting messages out to the Lexington community.
 
You might be thinking, “Wait – this all sounds nice, but what is OurCommonPlace?” Take a look at the attached PDF to give you a better sense of who we are and what we’re trying to do here in Lexington.
 
Even better, go on the website and take a look for yourself!  The first step is to <b>create a profile on OurCommonPlace Lexington</b>, which is quick and easy – you just need a valid email address and Lexington street address, and you’ll be on the site in seconds.  Go to www.Lexington.OurCommonPlace.com and follow the simple instructions to get started.
 
Then, <b>we will create a community page for <<ORGANIZATION>></b>.  You can use this page to share events and announcements with Lexington neighbors on the OurCommonPlace network.  A community page is a fantastic way to gain visibility and engage with neighbors – everyone who has signed up with OurCommonPlace Lexington will receive your posts via email in their Daily Bulletin. 
 
After we create your community page, you’re ready to go! You just need to <b>get the word out to your neighbors about OurCommonPlace</b>, so that <<ORGANIZATION>> can reach as much of the Lexington community as possible.  Email members of <<ORGANIZATION>> to let them know you’re using OurCommonPlace, and ask for ideas on what to post.  Add OurCommonPlace on <<Facebook>> and <<Twitter>>, and mention us on your own Facebook and Twitter so everyone knows where to find your announcements.  Email your neighbors, family, and friends in Lexington - let’s get the entire town on board this new community initiative!
 
As the community organizer for Lexington, I’m here to help in whatever way I can. Please feel free to give me a call or email if you have any questions or feedback.  
 
Will you join our mission to revitalize community life and build a better Lexington together?
 
Best,
Chava","Subject Line: Participating in Lexington.OurCommonPlace.com

Hi <First Name>,

We are happy to hear you’re interested in participating in Lexington.OurCommonPlace.com, and we hope you can find it a useful tool for publicizing announcements and events from your organization.  Here are steps for getting involved:

Register an account for yourself on OurCommonPlace Lexington.  You can do this by going to Lexington.OurCommonPlace.com and filling out the quick questions to verify you live in Lexington:  
We will create an OurCommonPlace community page for you.  Once we transfer ownership to your account, you can begin sending out events and announcements to your neighbors through your page.
Publicize that your organization started an OurCommonPlace page so that everyone knows where to find <ORGANIZATION NAME>’s announcements and events.  You can facebook and tweet about it, as well as email neighbors through OurCommonPlace’s invite page.  We would also love to have OurCommonPlace add you as a friend on facebook so we can thank you for joining this growing community engagement movement. 

Let me know if these sound like good first steps for you and <<ORGANIZATION>>.  As always, feel free to email me with any questions, concerns or ideas at Pete@OurCommonPlace.com.

Thanks,

Pete Davis

Hi <firstname>,

This is Pete Davis from OurCommonPlace Lexington.  I wanted to write again to make sure that <Organization Name> is included in Lexington.OurCommonPlace.com, Lexington’s new community-building web platform.  The platform -- which is completely free to utilize -- makes it really easy for organizations and entities in town -- like the library, the Boy Scouts and <organization> -- get the word out to Lexington residents about their events and announcements.  We would love to have a quick phone call with you and any other interested members to discuss how <organization name> can be included in the platform and other aspects of the OurCommonPlace Lexington community-building initiative.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
