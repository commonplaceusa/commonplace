      %h2 How CommonPlace Works

      %ul
        %li
          %img{ :src => "/assets/learn_more/sign_up_screen_shot.png", :size => "300x210" }

          %h3 1. Sign Up
          
          %p CommonPlace brings your neighbors and civic leaders in #{@community.name} together onto one 'community network' online.

          %p Sign up once and you'll start receiving short email messages from your neighbors and community leaders like the police chief and the mayor.

        %li
          %img{ :src => "/assets/learn_more/bulletin_screen_shot.png", :size => "300x210" }

          %h3 2. Receive Community Bulletins

          %p Each day you'll receive a 'community bulletin' featuring events and announcements written by your neighbors and local leaders. Learn about local events. Find a good mechanic. Join a new biking group.

          %p Whenever something's interesting to you, you can hit 'reply' and start a community conversation.
 
          %div{:style => "clear: both;"}

        %li 
          %img{ :src => "/assets/learn_more/community_screen_shot.png", :size => "300x210" }

          %h3 3. Search the Community

          %p All these community conversations, events, and announcements can always be views at <a href='http://#{@community.slug}.ourcommonplace.com/'>#{@community.slug}.OurCommonPlace.com</a>.

          %p CommonPlace centralizes community information. Use it to search for people in your area, find cool local organizations, or locate goods and skills in your neighborhood.

          %div{:style => "clear: both;"}

        %li 
          %img{ :src => "/assets/learn_more/post_screen_shot.png", :size => "300x210" }

          %h3 4. Post to the Neighborhood

          %p Of course, whenever YOU have a need or announcement, CommonPlace makes it really easy to share it with the people around you.
  
          %ul
            %li Ask to borrow a ladder or a power drill
            %li Publicize a tag sale or block party
            %li Ask about how to fix a pot hole
            %li Organize service projects for #{@community.name}

        %h3 In Order to Form a More Perfect Community
        %p Because community is the heart of Raleigh, and because our neighborhoods are made up of amazing and inspiring neighbors who love their families and want to help each other, it is time we hammer the Internet into a tool that unites rather than divides our communities.
        %p (A beautiful article about CommonPlace published in <strong>The Raleigh Creative District</strong>)
