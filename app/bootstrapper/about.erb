            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>OurCommonPlace is a national civics &amp; technology organization that works to revitalize the spirit of local community engagement in towns and cities across the country.</p>
            <p><%= @community.slug %>.OurCommonPlace.com was built by our team in Cambridge, MA and was launched with support from the <%= @community.name %> community. To learn more about our team go here and see some of our sponsors go here.</p>
            <p>We believe in technology. But we know it's not enough. We work with our partnership communities to run through a full organizing plan designed to empower, celebrate and inspire local leadership.</p>
            <p class="highlight">Empower: We help local leaders &#8220;plug in&#8221; to the Internet.</p>
            <p>The <%= @community.slug %>.OurCommonPlace.com is designed to make it delightfully easy for <%= @community.name %> neighbors and community leaders to share and connect with the people around them. You can view a tutorial here.</p>
            <p>But we know that <%= @community.name %>'s CommonPlace is only one tool at a leader's disposal. Our organizers work with leaders to help them create &#8220;digital strategies‚Äù for advancing their projects. Contact one of our organizers right now.</p>
            <p class="highlight">Celebrate: Our national Civic Hero Awards program spotlights beloved local leaders in town.</p>
            <p>OurCommonPlace runs a national awards program dedicated to celebrating local leaders everywhere.</p>
            <p>With input from the <%= @community.name %> community, we search for leaders whose work at the schools, at service organizations, in the local government, or at a great local business, have made <%= @community.name %> a better place to live in.</p>
            <p>We then publish profiles of their work on the town's OurCommonPlace platform and on our national awards page. To nominate a leader go here.</p>
            <p class="highlight">Inspire: We train ambitious students to be 21st century community organizers with our Civic Heroes Leadership Program.</p>
            <p>OurCommonPlace works with ambitious students who are interested in learning the skills of a 21st century community organizer.</p>
            <p>Students leave the Civic Heroes Leadership Program with a base of knowledge about how to organize in their community, how to publish online and how to inspire others to act. They'll also get close to a group of engaged young people based in Harvard and in towns across MA. To learn more go here.</p>

            <h3>Who We Are</h3>
            <p>OurCommonPlace began with a story about bowling.</p>
            <p>In 2009, two freshman-year roommates at Harvard read the book <em>Bowling Alone</em> by Robert Putnam.</p>
            <p>The book was a revelation. In it Putnam used data to prove something we all know in our hearts: that when communities come together, they prosper. He found that in communities where neighbors know each other's names, and feel like they can trust each other, the streets are safer, the schools are more effective, the businesses are more productive, and everyone is happier and healthier. Community was a magical variable for making our lives better.</p>
            <p>Yet, Putnam said, there's reason to worry about the future of local civic engagement. The institutions that have traditionally connected us to our communities -- the community centers, Rotary clubs, local newspapers and yes, bowling leagues -- were in a state of transition. As our lives have changed, so have our communities.</p>
            <p>We began by asking ourselves: How can we help? How can technology play a role in revitalizing our local communities?</p>
            <p>OurCommonPlace is our answer to that question. It's like a newsletter written by your neighborhood, or a community center bulletin board designed to fit into your email inbox.
            </p>
            <p>We dream of an Internet that works for local communities. That works for parents who want to share resources. For local leaders who want to create something for the people around them. For anyone who wants to make something happen in local world they are a part of.</p>
            <h3>Our Team</h3>
            <p>We're a team of young technologists and veteran community organizers based in Cambridge, MA.</p>
            <p class="highlight">Non-profit? For profit?</p>
            <p>The OurCommonPlace web platform is developed by a professional web development team run by the OurCommonPlace s-corporation. We believe in in a world where businesses do well by doing good.</p>
