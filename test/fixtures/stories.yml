    <p>The bad news is, a mosquito tested positive for West Nile Virus last month in Cuyahoga Falls; the good news is, no other cases have been found.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>According to Andrew Deikun, a mosquito control coordinator with the Summit County Public Health Department, the mosquito carrying West Nile was caught in a trap set on Bonnett Drive on July 17.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>As a precautionary measure, the health department sprayed within a one-mile radius of Bonnett on Aug. 6 to target and kill adult mosquitos.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Since then, two traps have been placed on Bonnett \xE2\x80\x93 one on Aug. 7, the other on Aug. 22 \xE2\x80\x93 to determine whether mosquitos may still be carrying West Nile in the neighborhood.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Mosquitos caught in the trap set on Aug. 7 were tested by the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpublichealth.columbus.gov%2f\">Columbus Public Health Department</a> and the results came back negative. Deikun will know early next month whether any cases were found in the second trap since it takes about two weeks to get test results back.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>On Sept. 9, 13 residents from Lexington will walk up to 26.2 miles along the historic route of the Boston Marathon in the 24th annual <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.jimmyfund.org%2feve%2fevent%2fboston-marathon-jimmy-fund-walk%2f\">Boston Marathon Jimmy Fund Walk</a> presented by Hyundai. They will be among the 9,000 walkers expected to participate with the collective goal of raising more than $7.5 million to support lifesaving adult and pediatric patient care and cancer research at <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dana-farber.org%2f\">Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Boston Marathon Jimmy Fund Walk is the largest single-day participatory event benefiting the Jimmy Fund and Dana-Farber and has raised nearly $80 million since its inception in 1989 to conquer all forms of cancer. The <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.baa.org%2f\">Boston Athletic Association</a> has supported the Boston Marathon Jimmy Fund Walk for the past 24 years.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CEvery year, the Boston Marathon Jimmy Fund Walk unites thousands of people \xE2\x80\x94 from parents, neighbors, coworkers, cancer patients, cancer survivors, and the young and the old \xE2\x80\x94 who share a goal to bring an end to cancer,\xE2\x80\x9D says Ann Beach, director of the Boston Marathon Jimmy Fund Walk. \xE2\x80\x9CTheir dedication and commitment to fundraising for the event enables Dana-Farber to aggressively pursue its life-saving mission.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Participants may choose to walk one of four routes: the entire 26.2-mile Hopkinton to Boston route, the 13.1-mile Babson to Boston route, the 5-mile Boston College route, or the 3-mile route starting at Dana-Farber\xE2\x80\x99s campus. Those unable to participate on Boston Marathon Jimmy Fund Walk day can become \xE2\x80\x9CVirtual Walkers\xE2\x80\x9D and still fundraise for the event.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Walkers begin in Hopkinton between 5:30-7:30 a.m.; at Babson College between 8:30-9:30 a.m.; at Boston College between 10 a.m. and noon; and from Dana-Farber at 1:30 p.m. The Boston Marathon Jimmy Fund Walk finishes at Copley   Square in Boston, where walkers can celebrate completing the course and enjoy complimentary food, beverages, a speaking program, and entertainment.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>All walkers must raise a minimum of $300, and walkers 12-years-old and younger have a fundraising minimum of $100. Pacesetters are extraordinary fundraisers who raise $1,250 or more. Young Pacesetters are children 12 years old and younger who raise $500 or more.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; Politicians like to say campaigns are a marathon, not a sprint. But New Hampshire is turning into a relay-race, with presidential candidates and their spouses handing off the baton to each other over the next few days.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Jill Biden, wife of Vice President Joe Biden, kicked things off Friday, stopping by campaign offices in Concord, Berlin, Conway and Laconia. She'll be followed in quick succession by President Barack Obama on Saturday and the vice president on Monday. First lady Michelle Obama had been scheduled to speak at the University of New Hampshire on Tuesday but cancelled because the school is closing due to the approaching storm.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Meanwhile, Republican Mitt Romney&rsquo;s wife, Ann, will campaign in the state on Monday, and Romney plans to hold a rally Tuesday evening in the Manchester area.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan made two trips to New Hampshire in late September, but Romney hasn&rsquo;t been in the state since Sept. 6, the same day Obama, Biden and their wives campaigned in Portsmouth. Biden has been back twice since then; Obama returned for a rally last week.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The activity underscores the degree to which New Hampshire&rsquo;s four electoral college votes are valued in what is expected to be a close election. And while the Obama campaign has logged more high-profile visits recently, the Romney campaign insists it has momentum on its side.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>A WMUR-TV Granite State poll released Oct. 9 showed Obama with a slight lead over Romney in New Hampshire. A Suffolk University/7 News poll released a week later showed the two tied. Romney also recently began running television ads in the Boston market, which stretches into southern New Hampshire.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;The Obama campaign seems to be panicking,&rsquo;&rsquo; Romney spokesman Ryan Williams said Friday. &lsquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re seeing steady stream of visits from the candidates and their spouses in next several days.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In Concord on Friday, Jill Biden urged volunteers to sign up for a few more shifts and to make a few extra calls, saying their efforts could make the difference. Biden, who teaches English at a Virginia community college, emphasized the Obama administration&rsquo;s efforts to make college more affordable, and highlighted what she called the &lsquo;&lsquo;kind of scary&rsquo;&rsquo; things Republicans have said about women&rsquo;s health care and reproductive rights.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;So many women of my generation, we fought so hard for Roe vs. Wade, for access to contraception and for equal rights. We want to make sure our daughters and granddaughters don&rsquo;t have to re-fight those battles we fought decades ago,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;&lsquo;Everything we fought for is at stake.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Biden also spent a few minutes making calls to supporters to thank them for their efforts. Sitting next to her was volunteer John King, who twice asked the undecided voters he was calling if they wanted to talk to the vice president&rsquo;s wife. Both turned down the offer.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;They dissed her,&rsquo;&rsquo; he joked, then clarified that both voters said, &lsquo;&lsquo;No, thank you.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>King said he&rsquo;s been surprised that the undecided voters he&rsquo;s spoken to tend to be older. Most say the economy is driving their decision. Some days he&rsquo;s had success nudging them toward Obama, he said, while other days are less successful.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="">

    </p><p>Is it common sense to allow cities and towns to pass rules specific to certain dog breeds, such as pit bulls, in the name of public safety? Or do they unfairly target certain dogs?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Last week, Gov. Deval Patrick signed an animal rights bill that takes effect Nov. 1 and includes a stipulation prohibiting cities and towns from creating breed specific rules at the local level.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The move has angered some Boston officials, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.bostonherald.com%2fnews%2fpolitics%2fview.bg%3farticleid%3d1061155151%26amp%3bsrvc%3drss\">the Boston Herald reports</a>, as the new state law would negate the city's \"<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cityofboston.gov%2fanimalcontrol%2fregulations%2fpitbull.asp\">Responsible Pit Bull Ownership</a>\" ordinance that, among other rules, requires pit bull owners to keep their dogs muzzled when off the owner's private property. Boston adopted the ordinance in 2004 after several pit bull attacks in the city captured officials' attention.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Other cities have also wrangled over how to deal with a perceived issue regarding pit bulls and public safety. In Malden, the city council approved a bill this spring that would have <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fmalden.patch.com%2farticles%2fcity-will-require-muzzles-on-some-pit-bulls\">required muzzles for newly registered pit bulls</a>, but Mayor\xC2\xA0Gary Christenson later <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fmalden.patch.com%2farticles%2fpit-bull-law-goes-un-vetoed-but-with-suggested-amendments\">vetoed the bill</a> and suggested amendments to the law.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>After his veto in April, Christenson wrote to the council, \"The ordinance should be centered on how a dog behaves and not how a dog looks as I believe this legislation suggests.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Best Friends Animal Society says about <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.bestfriends.org%2fnomorehomelesspets%2fpit_bulls.cfm\">half of the dogs killed in shelters today are pit bulls or pit bull mixes</a>, and that there are 20 different species of\xC2\xA0dogs that are commonly confused with pit bulls, thus making breed-discriminatory rules hard to enforce.\xC2\xA0The Humane Society of the United States says that in media-reported animal cruelty cases, dogs and <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.humanesociety.org%2fissues%2fabuse_neglect%2ffacts%2fanimal_cruelty_facts_statistics.html\">in particular pit bulls are the most common victims of animal cruelty</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>On the other hand,\xC2\xA0DogsBite.org, a national dog bite victims' group, says that from 2006 to 2008,\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dogsbite.org%2fdogsbite-newsroom-2009-dogsbite-three-year-fatality-study.php\">pit bulls accounted for 59 percent of all fatal dog attacks</a> in the U.S. The next highest breed, rottweilers, accounted for 14 percent of those deaths.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Is the new state law prohibiting breed specific local ordinances turning a blind eye to a problem? Or do those types of rules unfairly target a specific breed and punish dogs for having bad owners? Tell us what you think in the comments below.</strong></p>\n\

  content: "<div><div>\n\
    <p><b>Back to School Calendar</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Teachers within the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flps.lexingtonma.org%2f\">Lexington Public Schools</a> head back to school next Monday, Aug. 27. For students, the school year begins the following day, Tuesday, Aug. 28, with the first full day for all students on Wednesday, Aug. 29. And then school\xE2\x80\x99s closed on Aug. 31 (offices open though) and Sept. 3 for Labor Day. Back to School nights are: Thursday, Sept. 20 for elementary schools, Sept. 27 for the middle schools and Oct. 4 for Lexington High.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>Getting to School</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>For those students signed up to take the bus to school, passes were mailed out earlier this week. According to the district website, bus routes will not be published in the local newspaper, nor will they be posted online. The website does not explain why this decision was made, and the district\xE2\x80\x99s Transportation Coordinator Elaine Celi did not immediately respond to an email from Patch requesting elaboration. Meanwhile, elementary school families can expect an email blast regarding after school bus schedules. </p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>In Administrative News</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>There\xE2\x80\x99s been a bit of moving and shaking among administrators within the Lexington Public Schools.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>One of those moves was the appointment of Anna Monaco as the new principal of Jonas Clarke Middle School. Monaco, the unanimous choice of a search committee, previously served as an assistant principal at Clarke. She takes over for outgoing Principal Steven Flynn, who\xE2\x80\x99s leaving Lexington for an administration job in Saudi Arabia. </p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Another new principal is Laura Lasa, who was appointed to the top spot at Lexington High after her predecessor, Natalie Cohen, announced her retirement plans. Lasa came up through the Lexington Public Schools and was an associate principal at LHS prior to her appointment. </p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>Meal Time</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Meal pricing is consistent across the board within the Lexington Public Schools. At the elementary, middle and high schools, a full-priced lunch costs $3.25, while reduced price lunch is 40 cents. At all schools, full-priced breakfast costs $2 and reduced breakfast is 30 cents.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Earlier this summer, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flps.lexingtonma.org%2fsite%2fdefault.aspx%3fPageType%3d3%26amp%3bModuleInstanceID%3d24%26amp%3bViewID%3d047E6BE3-6D87-4130-8424-D8E4E9ED6C2A%26amp%3bRenderLoc%3d0%26amp%3bFlexDataID%3d2742%26amp%3bPageID%3d1\">Whitsons School Nutrition announced its new partnership with LPS</a>, and that they\xE2\x80\x99ll provide a dining program in which meals meet the new Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act requirements</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>A Little Bit About Aspen</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>If you\xE2\x80\x99re new to the district, then you must get hip to Aspen, the secure student information management system LPS uses to manage student grading, scheduling, attendance and other data.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>Link Dump! </b></p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>To the Editor,</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>As  your state representative, I have had privilege of working with Susan  Fargo to represent our community at the State House, and I can tell you  there is no better candidate to take her place than <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.joekearnsgoodwin.com%2f\">Joe Kearns Goodwin</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Concord is the heart of the Third Middlesex District, and Joe\xE2\x80\x99s home. He grew up steps from the Old North  Bridge and understands, unlike no one else in the race, the rich  history and natural landscape here and why we must fight to preserve it  for generations to come.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In  1999, he took a semester off from <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fharvard.edu\">Harvard College</a> to help me run my  first campaign to become your State Representative. Two years later, Joe  could have done nearly anything with his degree or gone anywhere with  his career, but following the events of 9/11, he enlisted in the Army  out of a sense of duty to our community. He saw no reason anyone should  be in line before him to serve the community we all love so much.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>At  no point in his life has Joe ever forgotten where he came from. As our  state Senator, Joe will always keep fighting for\xC2\xA0Concord and the Third Middlesex, no matter how difficult the challenge or entrenched the  special interests. He is committed to standing up for our environment  and seniors, defending education funding, and fighting\xC2\xA0for middle class  families. Some candidates run for office in order to fulfill a personal  dream or add to a list of accomplishments; Joe is running to genuinely  improve the lives of those around him.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Joe  will never stop fighting for our values and to ensure the next  generation has the same opportunities he had. I urge you to join me in  voting for him on Thursday, Sept. 6.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>&#13;\n\

  content: "<div><div><p><b>\xC2\xA0</b>Norman L. Daggett, 91, of Concord and formerly of Lexington, died on August 22, 2012.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Born on May 19, 1921 to Harold and Ethel Daggett in Montclair, NJ, he grew up in Barnstable, MA.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>From early childhood, his engineering bent was in evidence. He became an electrical engineer, receiving a bachelor's degree from MIT in 1947.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>His college education was interrupted by World War II. He enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1942 and was sent to Officer Candidate School to train as a radar officer. In the fall of 1943, he was sent to East Anglia, England as a Communications Officer in the 8<sup>th</sup> Air Corps, serving there until the end of the war. His last station was RAF Tibenham, near Norwich, in the 8<sup>th</sup> Air Corps 2<sup>nd</sup> Division, 703<sup>rd</sup> Bombardment Squadron of the 445<sup>th</sup> Bomb Group, under then-Captain and Squadron Commander James Stewart, the American film and stage actor. He left the service in November 1945 with the rank of Captain.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>After graduating from MIT, Jay Forrester of MIT hired him as a research assistant to work at MIT's Digital Computer Laboratory on Whirlwind, an early digital computer. A short stint at Bell Aircraft in Niagara Falls, NY interrupted his seven years of work at the MIT Barta Building under Mr. Forrester. Many of that group moved out to MIT's Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, where Norm and two others were in charge of the design of the next computer, the TX0. He worked in several groups at Lincoln Lab, serving for a time as an assistant group leader. Later he worked on orbital tracking of manned spacecraft for Project Mercury and subsequently on Project Westford, which sent a band of needles to be used for global communication into space. In 1969, he joined Interactive Data Corporation in Waltham, and there developed a packet network with error correction capability that he supervised until his retirement in 1988.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Norm was a long time member of the Appalachian Mountain Club. He enjoyed skiing, hiking in the White Mountains and Maine, and working on his computer.\xC2\xA0 He particularly loved spending time in Acadia National Park with family and friends; tea and popovers on the lawn of the Jordan Pond House after a hike was always a special treat.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>He is survived by his wife Marjorie of 50 years; his son John, daughter-in-law Ruri, and granddaughters Lilia and Milena of Tokyo, Japan; daughter Sally of Portland, ME; daughter Molly and granddaughter Alise of Seattle, WA; and son Thomas of Vancouver, Canada.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A memorial service will be held on Saturday, September 15, 2012 at 11:00 am in the Duvall Chapel, Newbury Court, 80 Deaconess Road, Concord, MA.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In lieu of flowers, donations in his memory may be made to MIT for the MIT Class of 1947 Endowed Scholarship Fund, c/o MIT <em>Director of Memorial Gifts, 600 Memorial Drive, W98-500, Cambridge, MA 02139.</em></p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>Is it common sense to allow cities and towns to pass rules specific to certain dog breeds, such as pit bulls, in the name of public safety? Or do they unfairly target certain dogs?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Last week, Gov. Deval Patrick signed an animal rights bill that takes effect Nov. 1 and includes a stipulation prohibiting cities and towns from creating breed specific rules at the local level.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The move has angered some Boston officials, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.bostonherald.com%2fnews%2fpolitics%2fview.bg%3farticleid%3d1061155151%26amp%3bsrvc%3drss\">the Boston Herald reports</a>, as the new state law would negate the city's \"<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cityofboston.gov%2fanimalcontrol%2fregulations%2fpitbull.asp\">Responsible Pit Bull Ownership</a>\" ordinance that, among other rules, requires pit bull owners to keep their dogs muzzled when off the owner's private property. Boston adopted the ordinance in 2004 after several pit bull attacks in the city captured officials' attention.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Other cities have also wrangled over how to deal with a perceived issue regarding pit bulls and public safety. In Malden, the city council approved a bill this spring that would have <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fmalden.patch.com%2farticles%2fcity-will-require-muzzles-on-some-pit-bulls\">required muzzles for newly registered pit bulls</a>, but Mayor\xC2\xA0Gary Christenson later <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fmalden.patch.com%2farticles%2fpit-bull-law-goes-un-vetoed-but-with-suggested-amendments\">vetoed the bill</a> and suggested amendments to the law.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>After his veto in April, Christenson wrote to the council, \"The ordinance should be centered on how a dog behaves and not how a dog looks as I believe this legislation suggests.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Best Friends Animal Society says about <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.bestfriends.org%2fnomorehomelesspets%2fpit_bulls.cfm\">half of the dogs killed in shelters today are pit bulls or pit bull mixes</a>, and that there are 20 different species of\xC2\xA0dogs that are commonly confused with pit bulls, thus making breed-discriminatory rules hard to enforce.\xC2\xA0The Humane Society of the United States says that in media-reported animal cruelty cases, dogs and <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.humanesociety.org%2fissues%2fabuse_neglect%2ffacts%2fanimal_cruelty_facts_statistics.html\">in particular pit bulls are the most common victims of animal cruelty</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>On the other hand,\xC2\xA0DogsBite.org, a national dog bite victims' group, says that from 2006 to 2008,\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dogsbite.org%2fdogsbite-newsroom-2009-dogsbite-three-year-fatality-study.php\">pit bulls accounted for 59 percent of all fatal dog attacks</a> in the U.S. The next highest breed, rottweilers, accounted for 14 percent of those deaths.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Is the new state law prohibiting breed specific local ordinances turning a blind eye to a problem? Or do those types of rules unfairly target a specific breed and punish dogs for having bad owners? Tell us what you think in the comments below.</strong></p>\n\

    <p>BOSTON (CBS) &#8211; Boston Police are putting the neighborhood of East Boston on alert. Three women were indecently assaulted in a six hour period. Police say there were two incidents around 6 a.m. the morning of September 26, and another just before midnight September 25.</p>
    <p>The first female victim was approached from behind in the area of Lexington and Putnam Streets. Police say the suspect engaged her in a brief conversation, then assaulted her before fleeing toward Day Square.</p>
    <p>The suspect is described as a black or black Hispanic male, dark complexion, approximately 30 years of age, with medium build wearing a black hoodie that was &#8220;turned up&#8221;.</p>
    <p>The second indecent assault involved a female victim who described a similar incident, occurring several blocks away at the corner of Brooks and Paris Streets. This time the woman struggled and fought off the attacker after the assault.</p>
    <p>The third incident occurred at Princeton and Putnam streets. The victim says the suspect possibly entered a grey van or SUV after the attack.</p>
    <p>Police have stepped up their patrols in the area and are urging residents to take safety precautions.

    \t\t\t\t\t\t<p>YES!\xC2\xA0 Exercise has been shown to be beneficial throughout pregnancy. Benefits include decrease in backaches, constipation, bloating and swelling. Additionally, regular exercise has been shown to prevent or treat diabetes that develops during pregnancy, especially in those women with a <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fsummahealth.org%2fhome%2fmedicalservices%2fBariatric%2fbmi\" target=\"_blank\">BMI (body mass index)</a> greater than 33.\xC2\xA0 Exercise also boosts your mood and energy level and helps you sleep better. Additionally, it creates good workout habits that can be continued after delivery.</p>\n\

These women include those with significant heart or lung disease, a cervix with early dilation or <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fCervical_cerclage\" target=\"_blank\">cerclage</a> (a treatment for a weak cervix); multiple babies, multiple episodes of bleeding in the second and third trimesters, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ivillage.com%2fwhat-low-lying-placenta%2f6-n-138496\" target=\"_blank\">low lying placenta</a> after 26 weeks, premature labor during this pregnancy, or <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fsummahealth.staywellsolutionsonline.com%2fSearch%2f85%2cP01198\" target=\"_blank\">preeclampsia</a>. Even if you do not have any of these conditions, talk to your doctor before starting a new workout.</p>\n\
    <p>If you have never exercised before, walking, swimming, cycling, or aerobics are excellent ways to start. Begin exercising a minimum of 5 minutes per day, increasing your exercise time by 5 minutes per week. The goal is 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most to all days of the week.</p>\n\
    <p>For those regular athletes, continue your previous workout routine with modifications as needed.</p>\n\
    <p>Exercises to avoid: down-hill skiing, contact sports, scuba diving, horseback riding, or activities with jumping or sudden changes in direction. Pregnancy hormones cause relaxation of the ligaments in the back and pelvis, making you less stable than before pregnancy, so try new exercises cautiously. After the first trimester, avoid lying flat on your back. At this point, your uterus is large enough to compress the vein that brings blood up from your legs to your heart. When this vein is compressed, the baby\xE2\x80\x99s blood and oxygen are limited.</p>\n\
    <p>While exercising, wear a well fitting sports bra and comfortable clothing. Drink plenty of water before, during, and after the workout to keep you and baby hydrated. Continue exercising as long as you feel strong and stable. Reasons to stop exercising include: dizziness, near fainting, increasing shortness of breath, chest pain, headache, muscle weakness, calf pain, loss of fluid from the vagina, vaginal bleeding, contractions, or decreased fetal movement.</p>\n\
    <p>Talk to you physician about your workout plan before you start, and if you have questions along the way. Exercise is physically and mentally beneficial throughout pregnancy. Staying active during pregnancy will make it easier to workout after delivery, helping you to lose weight and keep up with your new little one!</p>\n\

    \t<p>The moment after you have a baby\xE2\x80\x94like when the kid\xE2\x80\x99s head crowns and he bungee jumps from your uterus\xE2\x80\x94you need to cry. It\xE2\x80\x99s expected. If slimy babies give you the heebie-jeebies, you can ask for the baby to be power-washed first, and then begin to cry. If you are watching <em>Love &amp; Hip Hop</em> and drinking a Slurpee because you\xE2\x80\x99ve had an epidural (my personal recommendation from the Labor &amp; Delivery menu) you can scream, \xE2\x80\x9CI can\xE2\x80\x99t feel my legs!\xE2\x80\x9D then laugh at your own joke, and begin to shake and cry.</p>\n\
    <p>What is not acceptable? Upon seeing that your healthy bundle only weighs five pounds and some change, yelling, \xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s it?! Nah, son. You have the wrong baby.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\
    <p>Hashtag: my life.</p>\n\
    <p>You see, Tophs was supposed to be a huge baby. Mostly because I had overshot my pregnancy weight limit by fifteen pounds and needed someone to blame. But also because Elie Mae had weighed over eight pounds, and second children and boys are typically bigger. \xE2\x80\x9CHe\xE2\x80\x99s not measuring very large,\xE2\x80\x9D my OB/<span class=\"caps\">GYN</span> had said at my prenatal appointments, but I\xE2\x80\x99d heard the same with Elie Mae, so I just smiled.</p>\n\
    <p>Even after the nurses weighed Tophs and placed him on my chest, I still held out hope. Perhaps I been dealt the hand of an obese placenta? I estimated in one out of every 12,000 pregnancies (rates are surely higher in West Virginia), the woman develops a placenta more than twice the necessary size.</p>\n\
    <p>Turns out my feeding sac was normal. At my four-week check up, I finally had to look my postpartum flab in the face, thanks to my OB:</p>\n\
    <p><span class=\"caps\">HIM</span>: <del>You\xE2\x80\x99re just going to feel my finger here.</del> How much did you weigh today?</p>\n\
    <p>ME: [I told him the real number. I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t lie because the nurse was still in the room.]</p>\n\
    <p><span class=\"caps\">HIM</span>: And how much did you weigh before you got pregnant?</p>\n\
    <p>ME: [Please make this stop. I\xE2\x80\x99d rather have back-to-back pap smears with a chilled speculum.]</p>\n\
    <p><span class=\"caps\">HIM</span>: <span class=\"caps\">WHOOPSIES</span>!</p>\n\
    <p>That word. A terrible word to say to an adult. I say \xE2\x80\x9CWhoopsies!\xE2\x80\x9D when Tophs lets one rip in his sleep&#8212;because it\xE2\x80\x99s not his fault. I would love to pretend that gaining extra pregnancy weight is like sleep farting. Really it\xE2\x80\x99s like throwing back whole rotisserie chickens and keeping a spit on your dashboard during rush hour.</p>\n\
    <p>My doc followed up with, \xE2\x80\x9CI tell patients to lose the weight within six months.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\
    <p>The clouds lifted. <em>Six months?</em> I wanted to hug him. I wanted to hug that White man and invite him to dinner and make a movie about it.</p>\n\
    <p>Time was on my side. In November, I would walk through his office doors in my skinny jeans, pulling my wagon of fat behind me like Oprah.</p>\n\
    <p>Turns out six months is not an eternity. Already it\xE2\x80\x99s September, and I\xE2\x80\x99ve got eight more pounds to lose. Given the urgency of my <em>sitchiation</em>, you\xE2\x80\x99d think I\xE2\x80\x99d be happy we live a few blocks from the biggest gym on Grounds.</p>\n\
    <p>Let me tell you why I\xE2\x80\x99m not.</p>\n\
    <p>This gym belongs to athletes and hotties. It belongs to the girls with lean, muscular legs and fluorescent Nikes. (Where is everyone getting those neon shoes?) These girls wear stretchy, spandexy, sexy outfits from Lululemon. These girls do not wear Umbro shorts. (Where can I buy a sturdy pair of Umbros?) They drink smoothies for dinner that make them like soooooo full! and give them, like, natural energy. I stay hooked to a Starbucks caffeine pump and try not to eat a morning bun <em>every</em> morning.</p>\n\
    <p>These girls scare me. At one point, I was hot like them. As an undergrad, I went to this gym once a year, the week before spring break. I climbed up on the elliptical as a size four, pumped Ludacris on my Discman and thought about which white shorts would look best in South Beach. But I\xE2\x80\x99m not eighteen anymore, and the only shorts I\xE2\x80\x99m wearing are called spanks, and if anyone sees them on any beach or street corner or grocery store line, I will die.</p>\n\
    <p>Did I mention I have a membership to this gym? Like we pay for me not to go. Paul has one, too, but it\xE2\x80\x99s different with guys. Guys gain a little gut, lose a little bicep, but no one notices. And even if someone does, she just falls deeper in love. Girls will be like, \xE2\x80\x9CAww, he doesn\xE2\x80\x99t have as much time to workout because he\xE2\x80\x99s a family man.\xE2\x80\x9D Those same girls will look at me and say, \xE2\x80\x9CShe needs to be grass-fed and tethered to a Nordic Track.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\
    <p>At twenty-nine, I\xE2\x80\x99m on the fence. I\xE2\x80\x99m young enough to look like a student but postpartum enough to squeeze my thighs together when I sneeze\xE2\x80\x94or else watch pee trickle down my leg. Instead of admitting I\xE2\x80\x99m insecure, I avoid the gym by claiming my needs have changed. My conversations with Paul go something like this:</p>\n\
    <p><span class=\"caps\">PAUL</span>: Do you wanna get out of the house and go to the gym?</p>\n\
    <p>ME: Nah, they don\xE2\x80\x99t have childcare.</p>\n\
    <p><span class=\"caps\">PAUL</span>: I\xE2\x80\x99m offering to stay home with the kids.</p>\n\
    <p>ME: Yeah, but I need to go to a class. You know, strength in numbers. The Army.</p>\n\
    <p><span class=\"caps\">PAUL</span>: Don\xE2\x80\x99t they offer classes at the gym?</p>\n\
    <p>ME: Yeah, but with skinny undergrads where you have to dance and stuff.</p>\n\
    <p>That last excuse is legit. They don\xE2\x80\x99t have what I need. If I were to open a gym for postpartum women, I would offer classes like Underwater Kegeling, Wave Goodbye to Turkey-Neck Arms, and Get That Cellulite Outa My Face. A lot of people would come to my gym.</p>\n\
    <p>I\xE2\x80\x99m sure if I actually went to the gym near our dorm, it wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t be so bad. But in my head, it\xE2\x80\x99s apocalyptic. Here\xE2\x80\x99s how it plays out: I walk in and a gorgeous girl is changing out of her sneakers into her Sperrys. I admire her brown top-siders. She says, \xE2\x80\x9CWant to try them on?\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CUm, no, that\xE2\x80\x99s okay, but if you insist, what size are you and do you have any nude footies?\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\
    <p>She wears a seven-and-a-half, so I take her right shoe, and I slip it on. The leather is tender, the little tie on the top so dainty yet boatishly rugged, and I smile. Until I walk to the full-length mirror and see what I have always known and yet in this moment have irresponsibly forgotten: I <span class=\"caps\">HAVE</span> <span class=\"caps\">CANKLES</span>.</p>\n\
    <p>It all goes black.</p>\n\
    <p>Sometimes the scenario plays out a little differently: Instead of Sperrys, the girl wears a sundress with cowboy boots that won\xE2\x80\x99t zip over my calves.</p>\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you need?\xE2\x80\x9D she asks. \xE2\x80\x9CWide-calf boots?\xE2\x80\x9D Then haunting laughter.</p>\n\
    <p>So you know, I have good reason not to go to the gym. Sperrys are real. <em>They are out there, man</em>. Plus, I have other exercising options\xE2\x80\x94like DVDs hosted by former <em>Biggest Loser</em> trainer Jillian Michaels.</p>\n\
    <p>Jillian gets me. She gets that I have saddlebags, muffin tops, and pancake boobs. She is all, \xE2\x80\x9CStick with me, and I will get rid of trouble zones.\xE2\x80\x9D She promises to blast out my fat.</p>\n\
    <p>I read somewhere that Jillian Michaels vowed never to have a baby because it would ruin her figure.</p>\n\
    <p>So maybe she doesn\xE2\x80\x99t get me. But, hey, she is into diversity. One of her backup stretchers is White; the other is Black. And she flirts with them equally. She\xE2\x80\x99s all, \xE2\x80\x9CGet back to your mat and stop tryin\xE2\x80\x99 to steal my thunder\xE2\x80\x9D to Salima, the Black girl.</p>\n\
    <p>Yes, I know the words. I even know how the fake bongos change tempo between the planks and push-ups. You start to hear hints of Donna Summer near the thrusting portion of the video. But there are no poles involved. I don\xE2\x80\x99t know that people with trouble zones do well on poles.</p>\n\
    <p>I am comfortable, safe at home in my makeshift gym. I close the blinds so the students can\xE2\x80\x99t see me holding my boobs while I do jumping jacks (They don\xE2\x80\x99t make steel bras like they used to). I do my girl pushups\xE2\x80\x94\xE2\x80\x9CBeginners, you can start on your knees if you need to and work your way up\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94on Elie Mae\xE2\x80\x99s play mat, in between Toph\xE2\x80\x99s bouncer and swing. No one can judge me because no one can see me. Except for Paul. I always call him over for the hip thrusts. Suddenly, I am Brittany from MTV\xE2\x80\x99s <em>Daria: Am I getting stron-ger, babe</em>?</p>\n\
    <p>But even as I eat more salads and less fro-yo and meet Jillian in the living room three nights a week after the kids go to bed, something still nags me. It\xE2\x80\x99s not just the weight. The weight will go, even if it takes longer than six months. Even if I have to endure another round of <span class=\"caps\">WHOOPSIES</span>! But there\xE2\x80\x99s this sense that I keep bumping up against a ghost of my younger, collegiate self. She\xE2\x80\x99s prettier, more confident, smarter, and more successful\xE2\x80\x94and I\xE2\x80\x99m not sure she ever existed. But even if she didn\xE2\x80\x99t, even if I sketched her from exaggerated memories of my time at <span class=\"caps\">UVA</span>, she is real now. She\xE2\x80\x99s there when I run into former professors who thought I\xE2\x80\x99d be getting my Ph.D. right about now. I see her when a fellow alum asks, \xE2\x80\x9CSo are you <em>just</em> a mom?\xE2\x80\x9D I feel her near when each time I answer, \xE2\x80\x9CSo what brings you back to Charlottesville?\xE2\x80\x9D with my husband\xE2\x80\x99s credentials and fail to mention it\xE2\x80\x99s a quirky, intellectual town that\xE2\x80\x99s great for the two callings I love: motherhood and writing.</p>\n\
    <p>At some point this semester, I will have to drag myself to the gym. But I will also have to take myself to that place where I decided the older me is less desirable than the younger me, and figure out how to make peace.</p>\n\

    <p><strong>The McDonald\xE2\x80\x99s Buckeye Recruits of the Week</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong><em>OFFENSE</em></strong><strong></strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Taivon Jacobs</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>WR, No. 1, Senior</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>5-10, 160 pounds</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Hometown: Forestville, Md.</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Suitland High School</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Verbally committed to Ohio State over Akron, Boston College, East Carolina, Florida State, Hawaii, Maryland, Miami (FL), Michigan State, Nebraska, North Carolina, N.C. State, Notre Dame, Pittsburgh, Wake Forest and West Virginia.</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>The Scoop: </strong>There is the <em>Massillon </em>Missile (this week\xE2\x80\x99s cover boy, WR Devin Smith), and then there is the <em>Maryland</em> Missile \xE2\x80\x93 WR Taivon Jacobs from Forestville, Md. \xE2\x80\x9CCoach Urban Meyer loves speed, and that\xE2\x80\x99s something that I\xE2\x80\x99ve got,\xE2\x80\x9D Jacobs told Rivals.com after verbally committing to Meyer and Ohio State back in July. The 400-meter sprinter from the Washington, D.C., area, who has been clocked in the 40-yard dash in 4.4 seconds, was a bit of a surprise<br>\n\
    commitment for Meyer and the Buckeyes. And that\xE2\x80\x99s because it was expected that Jacobs would follow his older brother, Levern, to the University of Maryland. But as Jacobs told ElevenWarriors.com, \xE2\x80\x9CI got a feeling that this is where I should be and I really liked the way the program is one big family at Ohio State. The people and the tradition there are great and the fan base is unbelievable.\xE2\x80\x9D Jacobs racked up 922 receiving yards and 13 touchdown grabs last year for Suitland High School. And he also returned seven kickoffs and punts for TDs. Yes, he\xE2\x80\x99s a special talent \xE2\x80\x93 a player who will likely play as a freshman in 2013, especially on special teams. And a player who Meyer will no doubt fully utilize in his up-tempo, spread offense.</p>\n\
    <p><strong><em>DEFENSE</em></strong></p>\n\

    <p><strong>DT, No. 54, Senior</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>6-4, 305 pounds</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Hometown: Youngstown, Ohio</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Austintown-Fitch High School</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Verbally committed to Ohio State over Miami (OH), Michigan, Michigan State, Nebraska, Notre Dame, Pittsburgh, Tennessee, UCLA and West Virginia.</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>The Scoop: </strong>Funny how future Ohio State DT Billy Price wears the number \xE2\x80\x9C54\xE2\x80\x9D on his Austintown-Fitch Falcons navy and scarlet jersey. Funny how Price hails from Youngstown \xE2\x80\x93 the hometown of current OSU Third Team All-American DL John Simon, who dons the number \xE2\x80\x9C54\xE2\x80\x9D on his Scarlet and Gray jersey. \xE2\x80\x9CThe dream of playing for the Scarlet and Gray first came to me when I was in about eighth grade watching Johnny Simon tear things up on the d-line when he was only a freshman in college. I told myself \xE2\x80\x93 \xE2\x80\x98I want to be that guy,\xE2\x80\x99 and play in an atmosphere like that.\xE2\x80\x9D So with team captain Simon leaving for the NFL after the 2012 season \xE2\x80\x93 as he\xE2\x80\x99s a senior, the freshman Price will be there in Columbus to fill his fellow Youngstowner\xE2\x80\x99s huge void during the 2013 season. And with Price on board with the Buckeyes next year, that will now make a total of eight of his own defensive line recruits Coach Urban Meyer will have on his roster. Price will be at the forefront of Meyer\xE2\x80\x99s defensive overhaul. And what a haul for Meyer that Price is \xE2\x80\x93 as Price is widely regarded as one of the top three prospects in the state of Ohio\xE2\x80\x99s class of 2013.</p>\n\n\n        </div></div>"

    <p><strong>The McDonald\xE2\x80\x99s Buckeye Players of the Week</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong><em>OFFENSE</em></strong><strong></strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Jordan Hall</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>RB, No. 7, Senior</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>5-9, 194 pounds</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Hometown: Jeannette, Pa.</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Jeannette High School</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>The Scoop: </strong>As hard as this is to believe, it\xE2\x80\x99s nevertheless true: RB Jordan Hall led Ohio State to a 29-15 win over UAB last week by rolling up a career high 105 rushing yards. Yes, you read that correctly \xE2\x80\x93 a \xE2\x80\x9Ccareer high\xE2\x80\x9D 105 rushing yards. Considering Hall is a senior Buckeye, you\xE2\x80\x99d figure he\xE2\x80\x99d have at least a game or two of plus 150 yards rushing under his belt. But that\xE2\x80\x99s the not case, and Hall\xE2\x80\x99s career best game also marks the first time an OSU running back has eclipsed 100 rushing yards this season. All surprise and awe aside, it was nice to see exactly that happen: a Buckeye back finally breakout and help QB Braxton Miller carry the offense. For the game, Hall averaged 6.2 yards per carry with a long run of 14 yards. He also grabbed two passes for another 21 yards. And the 17 total rushing attempts were just one carry away from Hall\xE2\x80\x99s career high of 18 he set last year during the 10-7 home loss to Michigan State \xE2\x80\x93 how ironic, as the Spartans are OSU\xE2\x80\x99s upcoming opponent and first Big Ten matchup of the young 2012 campaign.</p>\n\

    <p><strong>Hometown: Akron, Ohio</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>St. Vincent-St. Mary High School</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>The Scoop: </strong>The shoes were filled quite adequately in the \xE2\x80\x98Shoe. With Ohio State\xE2\x80\x99s ultra-talented CB Bradley Roby out with a shoulder injury, sophomore CB Doran Grant stepped up into Roby\xE2\x80\x99s shoes, and helped guide the Buckeyes to a 29-15 win over UAB last week in Ohio Stadium, or the \xE2\x80\x98Shoe, if you will. \xE2\x80\x9CI think I did okay,\xE2\x80\x9D Roby said after the game. \xE2\x80\x9CI just came in and did what I had to do in the absence of Bradley Roby and in helping the team in any way I could.\xE2\x80\x9D Yeah, you bet, Grant did \xE2\x80\x9Cokay.\xE2\x80\x9D Heck, he was more than \xE2\x80\x9Cokay.\xE2\x80\x9D As the speedy corner from the same high school as LeBron James rackedup a career high seven tackles (five of which were solo stops), recovered a fumble and intercepted UAB QB Austin Brown in the fourth quarter. \xE2\x80\x9CYou have to make plays,\xE2\x80\x9D Grant said after the game. \xE2\x80\x9CYou need to come in and know your work and go 100 percent every time.\xE2\x80\x9D Grant\xE2\x80\x99s two turnovers (the pick and fumble recovery) were the only ones the Buckeyes gained against UAB. And Grant also picked up OSU\xE2\x80\x99s lone sack of the game. Chances are we\xE2\x80\x99ll start seeing a lot more of Grant on the gridiron.</p>\n\n\n        </div></div>"

    <br>\n  \n  <p>Recent criticism of our work at Life Line Screening comes from an <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.guardian.co.uk%2fscience%2fblog%2f2012%2foct%2f05%2fprivate-health-screening-tests\" title=\"article written by physician and writer Margaret McCartney\" target=\"_blank\">article written by physician and writer Margaret McCartney</a>, along with her new site PrivateHealthScreening.org. Those of us at Life Line Screening understand there will always be debate about health screenings. We\xE2\x80\x99ve always offered high quality, convenient, affordable private screenings that individuals can voluntarily choose if they have appropriate risk factors and decide that the screenings are right for them.</p>\n\
    <p>Criticism of Life Line Screening fails to account for the context in which screenings are taking place. In the U.S., stroke is the <strong>fourth most common cause of death</strong> and is the leading cause of adult disability (1). This is just one statistic among many that prove we need new ideas and strategies to alter these alarming facts. Identifying serious underlying disease before it leads to a catastrophic event is surely better than waiting until the event happens.</p>\n\
    <p>Dr. McCartney mentions that she believes that carotid artery screening is only worthwhile once the person has already had a stroke.  This simply does not make any sense. And waiting for \xE2\x80\x9Csymptoms,\xE2\x80\x9D as she suggests, is also a poor strategy as most strokes come without any warning.  Only about 15% of people who have a stroke have a warning \xE2\x80\x9Cmini-stroke\xE2\x80\x9D ahead of time, so for the vast majority of people, the stroke comes out of the blue (2).</p>\n\
    <p>Also, never in this conversation has Dr. McCartney discussed the benefits of a person finding disease and seeing a doctor in time to put preventive strategies in place. While she is extremely focused on the little possibility of false-positives, she never allows for the opposite and even more powerful situation \xE2\x80\x93 someone coming in with something serious who is now able to work with his or her doctor to get back on the right path, thus possibly averting a serious crisis.  In fact, a recent paper showed that preventive screening and treatment for vascular disease risks resulted in 14% reduction in premature death and an 11% reduction in reliance on long-term care in comparison to those who did not participate in the study (3).</p>\n\
    <p>Life Line Screening has many <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.lifelinescreening.com%2fabout-us%2fpersonal-stories%2fdefault.aspx\" title=\"customer testimonials\">customer testimonials</a> to attest to our services and is actively engaged in research to better understand the utility and efficacy of screening (4, 5).  No screening is without risk, and any screening has a small, but certain risk of adverse outcomes as have any medicines or surgeries. On the basis of probabilities, however, its advantages far outweigh potential risks. </p>\n\
    <p>Dr. McCartney and others are certainly free to disagree.  However, to ignore the possibility that a model that promotes <strong>education </strong>and <strong>prevention </strong>can serve a vital role in the health care continuum is to do a disservice to the very patients she cares for. You\xE2\x80\x99ve seen both sides of the story. Educate yourself with the facts. View our video below to discern for yourself.</p>\n\n\

    <p>October is\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nbcam.org%2f\">National Breast Cancer Awareness Month</a>. One of the greatest challenges for those who have been newly diagnosed is finding sources of support.\xC2\xA0Patients are eager for information on everything from enduring surgery and chemotherapy to how to deal with hair loss.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>While there are many <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2farticles%2fbreast-cancer-support-groups-in-concord\">local resources and support groups available in Concord</a>, women can also find comfort in a sisterhood of survivors who have already been in their shoes.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Best selling author and breast cancer survivor\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fbarbaradelinsky.com%2f\">Barbara Delinsky</a>\xC2\xA0has gathered the wisdom of hundreds of breast cancer survivors who are eager to inspire those who are new to the \xE2\x80\x9Cbreast cancer sisterhood.\xE2\x80\x9D She shares all of the stories and tidbits she found in her book \"<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.amazon.com%2fUplift-Secrets-Sisterhood-Breast-Survivors%2fdp%2fB0078XOJUY\">Uplift: Secrets from the Sisterhood of Breast Cancer Survivors.</a><a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.amazon.com%2fUplift-Secrets-Sisterhood-Breast-Survivors%2fdp%2fB0078XOJUY\">\"</a></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>First published in 2001, the book was updated for a 10th anniversary edition published last year. Delinsky donates all the profits from the book to fund a research fellowship at\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.massgeneral.org%2f\">Massachusetts General Hospital</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Delinsky describes <i>\"</i>Uplift<i>\"</i> as a \xE2\x80\x9Ccomprehensive support group in a book form.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a handbook of practical tips and upbeat anecdotes that I compiled with the help of more than 400 breast cancer survivors, their families and friends. They gave me the book that I wish I\xE2\x80\x99d had way back when I was diagnosed.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Not everyone knows what to say when a friend or family member reveals a breast cancer diagnoses. Some of the women in <i>\"</i>Uplift\" shared that when people don\xE2\x80\x99t know what to say, they say nothing at all, which Delinsky says is the worst possible choice.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CA note, an email, a voicemail simply saying 'I\xE2\x80\x99m thinking of you' is the kindest thing in the world.\xE2\x80\x9D\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>When Delinsky was looking for answers to questions, she found \xE2\x80\x9Cnurses more informative when it came to answering mundane questions that weren\xE2\x80\x99t mundane to me at all.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Delinsky says look to your local hospital, faith organizations and even your workplace as potential sources of support.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9COne of the comments I got over and over again from contributors to 'Uplift' was that after they were diagnosed, women came out of the woodwork to say that they\xE2\x80\x99d been there, that they understood, that they wanted to help.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Delinsky says that she believes her life is better for having had breast cancer.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"I cherish my husband and kids more than ever. I view my grandchildren as a gift. And my career is frosting on the cake! So many of my 'Uplifters' [women she quotes in her book] have taken breast cancer as a wake-up call to appreciate their lives all the more, even dared to go back to school or do something entirely different with their lives.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Those who are newly diagnosed with breast cancer also should be \xE2\x80\x9Cuplifted\xE2\x80\x9D by the large sisterhood of survivors that have lived to share their wisdom, says Delinsky.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CWomen are surviving breast cancer in numbers that were unheard of a generation ago. We\xE2\x80\x99re being diagnosed earlier and being treated more effectively. More than 2.5 million women have had breast cancer and are now alive and well. Much of this is the result of mammography. Any woman who fears the 'pain' of mammography should know that five seconds of discomfort can lead to years and years of a longer life.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\

  title: "Romney or Obama: Who Won The Final Presidential Debate?"
  community_id: "34"

    <p>Massachusetts Republicans and Democrats both expressed confidence in their candidates after the final presidential debate, with Republicans citing Gov. Mitt Romney projecting an image of a \"capable Commander-in-Chief\" and Democrats citing President Barack Obama's line about the military having \"fewer horses and bayonets\" as standout moments: that's the major finding of the Red and Blue Commonwealth flash polls sent out to local politicos immediately after the debate ended on Monday night.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Obama and Romney faced off Monday night at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla., with CBS's Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer moderating a debate that focused on foreign policy, but regularly delved back into domestic policy differences between the candidates.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Of the 21 local influential Republicans who took the flash poll, six (28.6 percent) said Romney won by a large margin, 12 (57.1 percent) said he won by a slim margin, two called the debate neutral and one voted that Obama won by a wide margin.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>On the other side, 22 local influential Democrats took the flash poll and 17 (77.3 percent) said Obama won by a wide margin, two said he won by a slim margin and three called the debate neutral.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Democrats surveyed also overwhelmingly said that Obama would be the consensus \"winner\" as declared by the national media: nine (40.9 percent) said by a wide margin and 12 (54.6 percent) said by a slim margin, while one said Romney by a slim margin.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Republicans surveyed were somewhat evenly divided on who they thought would be the consensus \"winner\" as declared by the national media: six (28.6 percent) said Romney by a slim margin, another six said it'd be neutral, 5 (23.8 percent) said Obama by a slim margin and four (19.1 percent) said Obama by a wide margin.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><h2>'Failed Policies' Versus a Military Equipment Zinger</h2><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Asked what moment would stand out in the minds of conservatives in Massachusetts, several local Republicans pointed to Romney attacking Obama's policies as president, while also saying the GOP nominee projected a strong and presidential presence.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Mitt looks like a Commander-in-Chief, Obama is still explaining his failed policies,\" one Republican poll taker wrote.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Another local Republican cited Romney's response when Obama said that the nation cannot \"go back to the same policies\" that led to the nation's difficult economic situation and needs to go forward.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t agree more about going forward,\" Romney replied, \"but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years ...\xC2\xA0It's just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous as ours that these last four years have been so hard.\"\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Asked what moment would stand out in the minds of progressives and liberals in Massachusetts, several local Democrats pointed to Obama's retort when Romney said that the U.S. Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"We also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed,\" Obama said. \"We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.\xC2\xA0And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting ships. It's what are our capabilities.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Other Democrats cited Obama attacking Romney's previously stated positions, which they characterized as \"flip-flops.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><h2>What About Swing Voters?</h2><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Asked what moment would stand out in the mind of swing voters in Massachusetts, some Democrats again cited the \"horses and bayonets\" line, while others pointed to Romney \"so often agreeing\" with Obama on foreign policy issues.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Romney backing off from every criticism of the President's foreign policy,\" one Democrat respondent wrote. \"And his closing, talking repeatedly about peace as if reciting something memorized. And not answering the President's comments about his campaign. He came out as if trying to get by and not make any waves.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>One local Republican also said that \"horses and bayonets line was memorable;\" however, one local Democrat said that Bay State swing voters would remember \"how calm and clear Romney was in his statements.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Other local Republicans cited Romney touting his ability to work with Democrats from his time as governor of Massachusetts, while others pointed to him repeatedly bringing the topic back to the question of the economy.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Twenty-three million Americans out of work and food stamps at an all-time high\xE2\x80\x94Obama has had four years to improve it and failed,\" one Republican respondent wrote.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><h2>Will the Debate Make a Difference?</h2><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Both sides believed that their candidate's performance would increase the number of votes their candidate would win in Massachusetts.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Eight local Republicans (38.1 percent) said they strongly agreed Romney's performance would increase his tally of Bay State votes, another eight somewhat agreed, four (19.1 percent) were neutral and one strongly disagreed.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Eleven local Democrats (50 percent) said they strongly agreed Obama's performance would boost his Massachusetts vote totals, eight (36.4 percent) somewhat agreed and three were neutral.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In final remarks, both sides returned to previous themes, with several Republicans citing Romney's \"statesman\" demeanor, which they contrasted with Obama's \"defensive\" and \"disruptive, undisciplined\" demeanor.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Several Democrats again cited Romney's \"etch-a-sketch treatment of a previous statement,\" as one respondent put it, and that Romney \"parroted\" Obama \"on most of his policies.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>That said, one person on each side of the aisle said that both candidates performed well, while another looked forward to Nov. 7, the day <em>after</em> the election.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Glad it's over,\" the respondent wrote. \"Now let's get through the next two weeks!\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong><em>Who do you think won the debate? Tell us in the comments below.</em></strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Red and Blue Commonwealth Surveys</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Our surveys are not a scientific, random sample of any larger population, but rather an effort to listen to a group of influential local Republican activists, party leaders, candidates and elected officials in Massachusetts. All of these individuals have agreed to participate in Massachusetts' Patch's surveys, although not all responded to this story's questions.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Patch will be conducting Red Commonwealth and Blue Commonwealth surveys throughout the 2012 election season in hopes of determining the true sentiment of conservatives and liberals on the ground in Massachusetts. If you are an activist, party leader or elected official and would like to take part in periodic surveys that last just a few minutes, please contact Associate Regional Editor Daniel DeMaina at danield@patch.com.</p>\n\

    </p><p>Oh, man, wasn\xE2\x80\x99t this weekend\xE2\x80\x99s weather simply superb?? I just love days like that in the middle of autumn; they take you by surprise and make you all happy. SO nice to be outside, enjoying the sunshine, especially after the crazy rain on Friday.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>For anyone who didn\xE2\x80\x99t make it over to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.westconcordvillage.org%2f\">Discover West Concord Village Day</a>, well, I feel very sad for you, because you missed a great party. I don\xE2\x80\x99t always go to events like this, especially on a Saturday when I\xE2\x80\x99m mostly driving from one sporting event to the next. But I decided to carve out an hour to go check it out, ended up spending two, and never made it past the railroad tracks. Which is unfortunate, because I didn\xE2\x80\x99t make it to the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vintagesonline.com%2f\">Vintages </a>wine tasting, or any other delectable delights up that way.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>I DID, however, manage to hit <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fdebrasnaturalgourmet.com%2f\">Debra\xE2\x80\x99s Natural Gourmet</a>, which was celebrating their birthday. It was chock-full of vendors offering samples of everything from vegan seafood to muesli. I personally sampled dried figs, chocolate, granola, bratwurst, chocolate, cheese, tea, chocolate \xE2\x80\x93 let\xE2\x80\x99s just say, enough food that it became my lunch. Oh, and birthday cake! I have a policy of never saying no to cake, and this was worth every bite.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>There was music on the porch of <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cheerful-reasons.com%2f\">Reasons To Be Cheerful</a>, and a table of organic wares from a woman getting ready to open a new store next to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.concordoutfitters.com%2f\">Concord Outfitters</a> (more on that later). And back on Beharrell Street, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.1on1si.com%2f\">1 on 1 Self Indulgence </a>was offering hand treatments and chair massages, while a performance of a Chinese dragon and drums happened nearby. Oh, and there was this really fun group of women from <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.yogaandniaforlife.com\">Yoga &amp; Nia for for Life</a> who danced in the street! They were SO fun to watch, and if I had any ability to move my feet in some synchronized manner, I would have totally joined them.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The weather cooperated beautifully to make this a spectacular event. And later, I heard that the Cocoa House at RTBC was a rousing success, with more people crammed in than ever before. All in all, a fabulous time was had by all over in West Concord \xE2\x80\x93 kudos to the people who worked hard and pulled it off!</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b><i>Welcome back, Judith!</i></b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>My good friend Judith Broggi is back in town. I told you all about her oh-so-interesting career path <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2farticles%2fsame-skills-new-career\">here</a>. She spent the summer back in her old stomping grounds of Chicago, doing some consulting at their very fine Art Institute, but has now returned to resume her Park Ranger duties here in town. She is also taking her passion for farming and channeling it into a community blog on the pages of wickedlocal, titled <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.wickedlocal.com%2fconcord%2fblog%2fbackforty\">\xE2\x80\x9CLife Begins at the Back Forty.\xE2\x80\x9D</a> If you, too, have an interest in farming and history, check out her writing; it\xE2\x80\x99s entertaining as well as informative.

  content: "<div><div>\n\
    <p>Generally speaking, a woman Massachusetts has a 133 in 100,000 chance of getting breast cancer, according to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fww5.komen.org%2fBreastCancer%2fStatistics.html%23USvar\">this</a> breast cancer statistics chart from <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fww5.komen.org%2f\">komen.org</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>An American woman in her 30s has a one in 232 chance of getting the disease, and a woman 20 years her senior has a one in 42 probability, according to the website.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CAlthough we aren\xE2\x80\x99t certain, the cause of breast cancer in younger women is likely caused by a genetic predisposition,\xE2\x80\x9D says Ann H. Partridge, M.D., M.P.H., the medical oncologist director of the Adult Survivorship Program at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women\xE2\x80\x99s Hospital.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>While <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fww5.komen.org%2fBreastCancer%2fYoungWomenandBreastCancer.html\">breast cancer treatment in young women</a> is often effective, the chance of recovery\xC2\xA0tends to be worse in women under 40. Breast tissue is often denser in younger women, making cancer harder to detect initially.<b> <br></b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>This is why many younger women are diagnosed at later stages with more aggressive tumors. These factors all contribute to an increased need for stronger <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cancer.gov%2fcancertopics%2fpdq%2ftreatment%2fbreast%2fPatient%2fpage6\">treatments</a>, says Partridge.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Unfortunately, some of these therapies have side effects that hit younger women in different and sometimes more difficult ways than their older counterparts.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>At the time of diagnosis, many young women are in the midst of building careers, getting married and starting families. A major concern for young women with breast cancer is loss of fertility. Both chemo and hormone therapies can damage the ovaries, causing irregular periods or a menopausal transition.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>For women in their 20s and 30s who continue to have their periods after chemotherapy, the ability to have children is still possible. Women who may want to become a parent after breast cancer should speak with their doctor about their options before choosing a treatment.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    &#13;\n\
    </p><p>Those who are diagnosed after starting families also face unique challenges.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CIt was difficult being 25 years old and finding out I had breast cancer, but it was even harder to figure out how to explain what was going on to my four-year-old son,\xE2\x80\x9D\xC2\xA0says Crystal King, an eight-year survivor and the manager of multicultural marketing for <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.circleofpromise.org%2f\">Susan G. Komen for the Cure Circle of Promise</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Another source of distress among young women with breast cancer is the way their appearance will be affected by treatments.\xC2\xA0Healthy or not, a woman's happiness with her breast size and shape can have an impact on her overall body image.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>Police were called to the Convenient 38 in Woburn Oct. 12 for a report of an assault. According to police, a woman stated she was in line with her three-year-old son, holding his hand, when the toddler shouted \xE2\x80\x9Che punched me, he punched me.\xE2\x80\x9D The child told his mother that one of four teenaged boys leaving the store had hit him in the face. Police spoke to the youths, who denied touching the boy. The responding officer told the woman that it was \xE2\x80\x9Chighly unlikely\xE2\x80\x9D that a teenager would hit a toddler holding his mother\xE2\x80\x99s hand and the woman agreed.\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpatch.com%2fA-yCMP\">http://patch.com/A-yCMP</a></p><p>&#13;\n\

When police arrived, a witness said the man had kicked over a headstone of a man who died in 1867 and had been cutting tree branches on the property. Police quickly caught up with the suspect and found him sitting on a gravestone. He told police he was playing hide and seek in the cemetary, but police did not see anybody else playing the game.\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpatch.com%2fA-yHLj\">http://patch.com/A-yHLj</a>\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>He was born on September 18, 1917, the son of the late Edward F. Flint Sr and Josephine (Ritchie) Flint. Henry was also the brother of the late Edward F. Flint Jr, Margaret R. Delling, and Charlotte H. Flint. \xC2\xA0Henry graduated Cambridge School 1935, taking additional courses at Franklin Institute, Boston, Boston University, M.I.T., Cambridge, and Northeastern University, Boston. \xC2\xA0He operated his father\xE2\x80\x99s farm from 1935- 1945. He was later employed by Trans-Sonic., Minneapolis-Honeywell Co. and Baird Atomic Co. Henry was a long-time member of the Appalachian Mountain Club and of the First Parish Church, Lincoln, MA. Henry was a life-long bachelor.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Henry\xE2\x80\x99s life-long passion for the natural world kept him outside as often as possible. In his younger years, Henry enjoyed hiking and skiing in the White Mountains and swimming and boating in Farrar Pond with friends. Henry\xE2\x80\x99s decision to stay on the family farm proved him to be both a loyal son, and a true Flint. Henry worked in the family McIntosh apple orchard and the farm greenhouses.\xC2\xA0 The delicate stevia flower was one of the primary crops, used in flower arrangements and sold at the Boston Flower Market during the early morning auctions. One of Henry\xE2\x80\x99s proudest \xC2\xA0moments was being awarded, by Henry Ford himself,\xC2\xA0 his beloved \xE2\x80\x9CSophia,\xE2\x80\x9D a Ford 9N tractor, in the New England Regional tractor operating finals in October of 1940, when a member of the National Farm Youth Foundation.\xC2\xA0 Henry\xE2\x80\x99s mental ability and mechanical aptitude helped him in the winning of the contest when he corrected the settings of the supplied equipment, and wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t let the rain slow him down. \xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In his later years, when slowed down by physical limitations, plowing the winter snows, mowing his lawn, tending his garden beds and keeping an eye on his bluebird houses brought Henry enormous pleasure. He was once heard to say that flowers and birds were the 8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> Wonders of the World. Henry delighted in memorizing poetry and scripture, keeping his mind sharp while reciting favorite writings over and over again. \xC2\xA0William Bryant\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9CTo a Waterfowl\xE2\x80\x9D was \xE2\x80\x9Cmemorized by heart when moving pots in the greenhouses.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xC2\xA0Despite the challenges he faced, Henry remained ferociously independent and totally uncomplaining. He was full of childhood stories of growing up on the farm, full of good humor, and was always more concerned about others and how life was going for them.\xC2\xA0 He was grateful for the sight of friends stopping by for a visit. (The door to his home was always open, or you could find the key outside in a plastic container to the right of the door.) \xC2\xA0Henry will be dearly missed by the many who were inspired by his stalwart attitude to \xE2\x80\x9CKeep on keepin\xE2\x80\x99 on!\xE2\x80\x9D He is survived by nieces and cousins.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Memorial Service, Saturday, November 17th at 2:00 p.m. in The First Parish in Lincoln, Bedford Rd., Lincoln. Interment was private in the family burial plot in Lincoln Cemetery.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>Halloween is less than two weeks away, so we're devoting this edition of Patch Picks to the upcoming haunted holiday.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>In my opinion, the best Halloween costumes are the ones that are homemade. It's fun to make your own costume, and can be an affordable option if you stick to items you already have around your house. Not to mention, you get to put your creative genius (or kids) to work.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Here are my picks for the best homemade Halloween costumes:</p><p>&#13;
    </p><ul><li><strong>God's Gift to Men/Women:</strong> This can be as simple or as elaborate as you'd like. Take a few cardboard boxes and used the material to make a you-sized box. Cut a head and arm holes in it. Then wrap the box in your favorite wrapping paper. Get in. Complete your outfit with a ribbon on your head and a giant gift tag that says: "To: Men, From: God." I won a costume contest with this one in 2006.</li>&#13;
    <li><strong>A Mummy: </strong>I was a mummy the year I wanted to put about 10 minutes of time into crafting a costume. All you need? Toilet paper. Do it yourself, or have someone help, by wrapping toilet paper all around you. Then go crazy with face paint or makeup to finish the effect. </li>&#13;
    <li><strong>Go Political:</strong> It's a great year to go as Mitt Romney or Barack Obama (maybe even Big Bird?) Just dress up in a suit and tie and carry props such as a binder (for Mitt) or a birth certificate (for The Prez). </li>&#13;
    <li><strong>Thrift Store Threads:</strong> Thrift stores are great places to find cheap, fun costume ideas. Think '80s snowsuits, lumberjack flannels or adult onesie pajamas. I even found an Easter bunny costume at a thrift store one time for $9. Major score.</li>&#13;
    <li><strong>Giant Pumpkin:</strong> You know those lawn leaf bags in the shape of a pumpkin? They make a great costume. Just cut leg, arm and head holes in the bag, reinforce the holes with tape so they don't rip, and fill with you, plus leaves, tissue paper or newspaper. </li>&#13;
    <li><strong>Jelly Bean Jar: </strong>Find a clear garbage bag and make it wearable following the steps in the "Giant Pumpkin" costume above. Blow up a bunch of balloons and stuff the bag. Write "Jelly Beans $.10" with a Sharpie and you're good to go.</li>&#13;
    &#13;
    </ul><p>I'm sure there are tons of other homemade Halloween costume ideas out there. <strong>Add yours in the comments!</strong></p>

    </p><p>Franken was in Massachusetts Oct. 19 to support <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fnorwood.patch.com%2farticles%2fnew-poll-gives-warren-a-6-point-advantage-over-brown-obama-leads-in-mass-by-14-points-60316c27\">Elizabeth Warren, the U.S. Senate candidate looking to unseat the Scott Brown</a>, the Republican incumbent, in a tight race many politicos expect will have ramifications far beyond the Commonwealth\xE2\x80\x99s borders. And the stumping stopped in Lexington Friday afternoon, whereFranken and U.S. Rep Ed Markey joined a few more familiar faces to address an overflowing crowd at the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexington.patch.com%2flistings%2flexington-depot\">Depot building</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>There were jokes aplenty, for sure, but the message was a serious one, and the importance of this race\xE2\x80\x94between Brown and Warren\xE2\x80\x94for Democrats, resonated in all remarks delivered before a highly partisan crowd.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Hanging in the balance is not just one seat representing one of the nation\xE2\x80\x99s bluest states, but also the future of the environment, middle class, Supreme Court and several key committees, the speakers said.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9COnce again it all comes down to Massachusetts; would you want it any other way?\xE2\x80\x9D said Markey. \xE2\x80\x9CMany people are saying, \xE2\x80\x98How big is this race?\xE2\x80\x99 Well, let\xE2\x80\x99s be honest. We are at one of those turning points in history, and this race between Scott Brown and Elizabeth Warren could determine which party controls the United States Senate.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>To \xE2\x80\x9Coohs\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cahhs\xE2\x80\x9D from the crowd, Markey went through the committees appointments that could be affected by the Brown-Warren race, including the Judiciary Committee, the Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources and the Environment and Public Works.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>While the environment was a big focus, and Franken also spoke about the impacts this race could have on the economy, calling Warren a \xE2\x80\x9Csiren\xE2\x80\x9D for the \xE2\x80\x9Csqueeze of the middle class,\xE2\x80\x9D and the Supreme Court.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CWe need someone from Massachusetts who knows that there\xE2\x80\x99s a difference between [Justice Antonin] Scalia and [Justice Sonia Sotamayor,\xE2\x80\x9D said Franken, riffing on <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.salon.com%2f2012%2f10%2f02%2fscott_brown_has_many_favorite_supreme_ct_justices%2f\">Brown's muddled response during a recent debate</a>. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd that [Justice Elena] Kagan is much more like Sotamayor than Scalia. Elizabeth, I hope is on Judiciary.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In closing, Franken, who won his seat by just 312 votes in 2008, implored Warren supporters to hit the streets in support of their candidate, even joking that it\xE2\x80\x99s OK to forget about their jobs and families because kids are resilient and 8-year-olds can not only use microwaves, but can teach 4-year-olds how to use them.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CMassachusetts is not going to control who goes to the White House,\xE2\x80\x9D Franken said. \xE2\x80\x9CBut we need to hold the Senate, we do know that, and that is within your control.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Also speaking at the event were state Rep. Jay Kaurman, D-Lexington, state Sen. Ken Donnelly, D-Arlington, and state Senate candidate Mike Barrett, D-Lexington.\xC2\xA0</p>\n\

The best of the Gold<br>recipients is designated the National GRAMMY Signature School. For schools that<br>are economically underserved, the GRAMMY Foundation established the <b>Enterprise Award</b> category to recognize<br>the efforts in music education made by these schools.. GRAMMY Signature Schools<br>recipients are determined by the Blue Ribbon Committee, a panel of top music<br>educators and professionals.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p><br>The GRAMMY Foundation was established in 1989 to cultivate<br>the understanding, appreciation and advancement of the contribution of recorded<br>music to American culture \xE2\x80\x94 from the artistic and technical legends of the past<br>to the still unimagined musical breakthroughs of future generations of music<br>professionals.

    </p><p>One Angel Foundation announces its 2<sup>nd</sup> Annual World Hike A Mountain Day on October 20, 2012 at Mount Wachusett in Princeton, Massachusetts. One Angel Foundation\xE2\x80\x99s mission is to help children and their communities mired in poverty by creating a model program that gives communities hope that during their lifetime poverty will be only a memory.\xC2\xA0 Last year approximately 400 hikers joined us at 18 US locations and 7 international locations for our 1<sup>st</sup> Annual World Hike A Mountain Day.\xC2\xA0 Please join us at Mt Wachusett. Registration and donation information can be found at <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.oneangelfoundation.org\">www.oneangelfoundation.org</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>One Angel Foundation was formed in honor of Jenna Agule, who passed away prematurely at 22 years old.\xC2\xA0 One Angel was created by friends and family with the hope of continuing her commitment to community service internationally by bringing hope and a smile to children in need around the world.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The monies raised last year from this event went to help complete a bi-lingual middle school in Julticalpa Honduras and a toy room in an AIDS Hospice at an orphanage in Capetown. Our goal this year is to begin to create a model community in Julticalpa Honduras of small compact homes that have common sewage, water and power all located on a small lot of 2-5 acres. Homes would be duplex in style and would contain approximately 500-600 SF each. Each of the homes would contain a small kitchen, bath, sleeping area and living area. Funds raised this year will be used to help fund in part the commencement of this community. Please go to our website: <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.oneangelfoundation.org\">www.oneangelfoundation.org</a> for more information. Registration information can be found at: http://www.active.com/outdoors/princeton-ma/world-hike-a-mountain-day-2012</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>While the hike at Mt Wachusett will serve as a festive home base for Hike A Mountain Day with a farmer\xE2\x80\x99s market, craft fair, family entertainment, sky rides to the summit and much more, participants will also be hiking all over the world at other host locations to fundraise for our mission.\xC2\xA0 Potential participants that are unable to travel to Mt. Wachusett for World Hike A Mountain Day are encouraged to hike at a mountain or trail near them.\xC2\xA0 Agule was a world traveler, hiking enthusiast and dedicated philanthropist who often hiked Mt. Wachusett and also traveled to Julticalpa for community service projects in the area. World Hike A Mountain Day honors Agule\xE2\x80\x99s love of nature and commitment to bringing hope &amp; a smile to families and children around the world.</p></div></div>"

  community_id: "30"

    <p>Massachusetts Republicans and Democrats both expressed confidence in their candidates after the final presidential debate, with Republicans citing Gov. Mitt Romney projecting an image of a \"capable Commander-in-Chief\" and Democrats citing President Barack Obama's line about the military having \"fewer horses and bayonets\" as standout moments: that's the major finding of the Red and Blue Commonwealth flash polls sent out to local politicos immediately after the debate ended on Monday night.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Obama and Romney faced off Monday night at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla., with CBS's Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer moderating a debate that focused on foreign policy, but regularly delved back into domestic policy differences between the candidates.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Of the 21 local influential Republicans who took the flash poll, six (28.6 percent) said Romney won by a large margin, 12 (57.1 percent) said he won by a slim margin, two called the debate neutral and one voted that Obama won by a wide margin.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>On the other side, 22 local influential Democrats took the flash poll and 17 (77.3 percent) said Obama won by a wide margin, two said he won by a slim margin and three called the debate neutral.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Democrats surveyed also overwhelmingly said that Obama would be the consensus \"winner\" as declared by the national media: nine (40.9 percent) said by a wide margin and 12 (54.6 percent) said by a slim margin, while one said Romney by a slim margin.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Republicans surveyed were somewhat evenly divided on who they thought would be the consensus \"winner\" as declared by the national media: six (28.6 percent) said Romney by a slim margin, another six said it'd be neutral, 5 (23.8 percent) said Obama by a slim margin and four (19.1 percent) said Obama by a wide margin.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><h2>'Failed Policies' Versus a Military Equipment Zinger</h2><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Asked what moment would stand out in the minds of conservatives in Massachusetts, several local Republicans pointed to Romney attacking Obama's policies as president, while also saying the GOP nominee projected a strong and presidential presence.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Mitt looks like a Commander-in-Chief, Obama is still explaining his failed policies,\" one Republican poll taker wrote.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Another local Republican cited Romney's response when Obama said that the nation cannot \"go back to the same policies\" that led to the nation's difficult economic situation and needs to go forward.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t agree more about going forward,\" Romney replied, \"but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years ...\xC2\xA0It's just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous as ours that these last four years have been so hard.\"\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Asked what moment would stand out in the minds of progressives and liberals in Massachusetts, several local Democrats pointed to Obama's retort when Romney said that the U.S. Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"We also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed,\" Obama said. \"We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.\xC2\xA0And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting ships. It's what are our capabilities.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Other Democrats cited Obama attacking Romney's previously stated positions, which they characterized as \"flip-flops.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><h2>What About Swing Voters?</h2><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Asked what moment would stand out in the mind of swing voters in Massachusetts, some Democrats again cited the \"horses and bayonets\" line, while others pointed to Romney \"so often agreeing\" with Obama on foreign policy issues.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Romney backing off from every criticism of the President's foreign policy,\" one Democrat respondent wrote. \"And his closing, talking repeatedly about peace as if reciting something memorized. And not answering the President's comments about his campaign. He came out as if trying to get by and not make any waves.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>One local Republican also said that \"horses and bayonets line was memorable;\" however, one local Democrat said that Bay State swing voters would remember \"how calm and clear Romney was in his statements.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Other local Republicans cited Romney touting his ability to work with Democrats from his time as governor of Massachusetts, while others pointed to him repeatedly bringing the topic back to the question of the economy.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Twenty-three million Americans out of work and food stamps at an all-time high\xE2\x80\x94Obama has had four years to improve it and failed,\" one Republican respondent wrote.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><h2>Will the Debate Make a Difference?</h2><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Both sides believed that their candidate's performance would increase the number of votes their candidate would win in Massachusetts.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Eight local Republicans (38.1 percent) said they strongly agreed Romney's performance would increase his tally of Bay State votes, another eight somewhat agreed, four (19.1 percent) were neutral and one strongly disagreed.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Eleven local Democrats (50 percent) said they strongly agreed Obama's performance would boost his Massachusetts vote totals, eight (36.4 percent) somewhat agreed and three were neutral.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In final remarks, both sides returned to previous themes, with several Republicans citing Romney's \"statesman\" demeanor, which they contrasted with Obama's \"defensive\" and \"disruptive, undisciplined\" demeanor.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Several Democrats again cited Romney's \"etch-a-sketch treatment of a previous statement,\" as one respondent put it, and that Romney \"parroted\" Obama \"on most of his policies.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>That said, one person on each side of the aisle said that both candidates performed well, while another looked forward to Nov. 7, the day <em>after</em> the election.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Glad it's over,\" the respondent wrote. \"Now let's get through the next two weeks!\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong><em>Who do you think won the debate? Tell us in the comments below.</em></strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Red and Blue Commonwealth Surveys</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Our surveys are not a scientific, random sample of any larger population, but rather an effort to listen to a group of influential local Republican activists, party leaders, candidates and elected officials in Massachusetts. All of these individuals have agreed to participate in Massachusetts' Patch's surveys, although not all responded to this story's questions.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Patch will be conducting Red Commonwealth and Blue Commonwealth surveys throughout the 2012 election season in hopes of determining the true sentiment of conservatives and liberals on the ground in Massachusetts. If you are an activist, party leader or elected official and would like to take part in periodic surveys that last just a few minutes, please contact Associate Regional Editor Daniel DeMaina at danield@patch.com.</p>\n\

    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CFor several years, I\xE2\x80\x99ve strived to create a significant way to give my music purpose. <b>\xE2\x80\x98til the Cure is Won</b> is a direct result of that effort. I wrote it on a day when I felt powerless to change what was happening to someone I loved. I hope the song will bring comfort and inspiration to everyone who hears it,\xE2\x80\x9D said Belitsky.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>\xE2\x80\x98til the Cure is Won</b> speaks to the hearts of those suffering from serious illness, as well as to the people who long to comfort them.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Belitsky began singing in nightclubs in the U.S. and Canada while still in her teens.

Paul Canfield said about 100 police officers will be in the downtown Kent area Saturday night, with officers from the Brimfield Police Department, Kent State University Police Department, Metro SWAT, the Ohio Highway Patrol and the Portage County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office assisting the city of Kent.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;As in years past, folks should plan on seeing a significant police presence in and around the downtown area,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;(People) should avoid driving through downtown Saturday night,&rdquo; Canfield said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always bumper to bumper.&rdquo;</p><p>He said people who plan on parking downtown should lock their vehicles, hide any valuables and travel in groups during the event.</p><p>Canfield said costumed visitors to downtown should also think twice before they bring accessories, advising revelers planning to bring anything that could be considered a weapon to leave it at home.</p><p>&ldquo;Please do not bring anything that resembles a weapon,&rdquo; Canfield said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen everything from people who have life-like replicas of guns to actual swords and hatchets.&rdquo;</p><p>He said people carrying life-like or actual weapons downtown would receive full police attention and possibly face criminal charges.</p><p>Beder said life-like weapons are one of the few reasons a patron may be barred from entry to Water Street Tavern or other downtown establishments.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a busy night and there&rsquo;s so many people out that we really don&rsquo;t make any exceptions,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If your face is painted to the point that we can&rsquo;t identify you by your ID, then we can&rsquo;t let you in. If a costume is too large or potentially hazardous, we don&rsquo;t let you in.&rdquo;</p><p>Beder said highly offensive costumes, such as a machine gun-wielding Osama Bin Laden that tried in the past, don&rsquo;t make it through the door either.</p><p>&ldquo;We want to make sure everyone is safe and comfortable and has a good time.&rdquo;</p><p>With all the changes and growth that has occurred in downtown Kent during the past year, Kent Area Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Lori Wemhoff recommends folks come early and see the changes.</p><p>&ldquo;With so much going on downtown these days, Saturday would be an ideal time for people to come down early and see the evolution of downtown Kent up close and personal,&rdquo; Wemhoff said. &ldquo;The increased foot traffic during the day and in the evenings has been great to see, I encourage anyone planning to come downtown on Saturday to come early to shop and eat local.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Contact Kyle McDonald at 330-298-1127 or <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.recordpub.com%2fnews%2farticle%2fmailto%3akmcdonald%40recordpub.com">kmcdonald@recordpub.com</a><br></em></p><p><em>Contact Thomas Gallick at 330-298-1127 or <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.recordpub.com%2fnews%2farticle%2fmailto%3atgallick%40recordpub.com">tgallick@recordpub.com</a></em></p></p>

    							<p>AKRON -- Police are seeking the suspects involved in two separate&nbsp;crimes that took place on Tuesday.</p>
    <p>The first happened shortly after 8 a.m. at the Six Corner's Deli in the 700 block of Eastland Avenue. According to Akron Police, an employee reported that two males entered the deli. One of the suspects approached the counter, pulled out a haundgun and demanded money from the register, while the other stayed by the door.</p>
    <p>The clerk reportedly opened the register and said she didn't have any money and both suspects fled the store southbound on Eastland Avenue empty-handed.</p>
    <p>The second&nbsp;incident occurred shortly before 9 p.m. as resident in the 2000 block of 18th Street SW reported they were the victims of a home invasion. The resident reported that two males, both armed with guns, entered the house and demanded that they get down on the floor. The suspects then demanded their money and cell phones.</p>
    <p>Although no injuries were reported, the suspects fled the scene with $5,000 cash and eight cell phones.</p>
    <p>Anybody with information in either incident is asked to contact Akron Police.</p>

    <p>The latest track of Hurricane Sandy has the storm pushing farther west according to this morning\xE2\x80\x99s meteorologists' reports. The National Hurricane Center has the center of the storm going either into southern New Jersey or Delaware.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>But this is a constantly changing storm, and a more northern track, which is possible, would signficicantly affect us here in New England.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>According to WHDH Meteorologist <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww1.whdh.com%2fweather%2fblog%2fpage%2f1%2f\">Chris Lambert,</a> the current likely scenario would bring wind and rain Monday afternoon through Tuesday with wind gusts of 40-60 mph, mostly onshore, strongest at the coast with up to 5 inches of rain expected throughout the storm\xE2\x80\x99s duration. Power outages are likely, along with beach erosion and coastal flooding during high tides.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Lambert says it\xE2\x80\x99s still a \xE2\x80\x9Cvery complicated and anomalous pattern\xE2\x80\x9D and thus the timing is tricky.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>If Sandy maintains a warm core longer into the forecast period, it may hold on longer than some of the models project. If that happens, the turn northwest into the coast would happen farther north and put southern New England in a more serious situation than the current path would take it. \xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nhc.noaa.gov%2ftext%2frefresh%2fMIATCPAT3%2bshtml%2f260848.shtml\">National Hurricane Center </a>has the hurricane currently with sustained winds of 80 mph, moving north at 13 mph. The storm is expected to decrease in speed today, followed by a turn toward the north tonight, and a turn toward the northeast on Saturday. The center of the storm will continue moving near the northwestern Bahamas this morning and move north of the Bahamas tonight.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Hurricane force winds extend outward up to 35 miles from the center, with tropical storm force winds extending up to 275 miles. Sandy\xE2\x80\x99s wind field is expected to grow in size during the next couple of days.</p>\n\

    <p>The case against <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpatch.com%2fA-yQsZ\">pipe bomb suspect David A. Dougherty</a> only seems to be getting stronger as\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fcuyahogafalls.patch.com%2flistings%2fcuyahoga-falls-police-department\">Cuyahoga Falls Police</a>\xC2\xA0hit him\xC2\xA0with additional felony counts and charges this week.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Dougherty, 49, of Cuyahoga Falls, now faces two counts of possession of criminal tools, trafficking in drugs, weapons while under disability and three counts of possession of dangerous ordnance (explosives), according to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.stowmunicourt.com%2f\">stowmunicourt.com.</a></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>He is also charged with illegal manufacturing of drugs, a fourth-degree misdemeanor; after police found a suspected marijuana grow operation in his residence.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>On Tuesday, Dougherty pled not guilty to the marijuana charge during an arraignment at Stow Municipal Court.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Regarding the felonies, Dougherty will be prosecuted either in Summit County Common Pleas Court; or, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in conjunction with the U.S. Attorney\xE2\x80\x99s Office may step in and prosecute, according to Falls Police Chief Tom Pozza.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>If the latter occurs, Dougherty\xE2\x80\x99s charges would be dismissed and federal charges -- which typically carry harsher penalties and sentences -- would be brought against him <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ohnd.uscourts.gov%2fcontact-us%2f\">in Akron\xE2\x80\x99s John F. Seiberling Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse</a>, said Pozza.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Due to the ongoing investigation, Pozza wouldn't comment on whether Dougherty had confessed to making the bombs or how he intended to use them.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>Pipe bombs found</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>On Oct. 20 at 2:30 p.m., Cuyahoga Falls Fire and EMS requested backup when Dougherty resisted paramedics that had entered his home to treat him for a medical emergency.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>As\xC2\xA0Cuyahoga Falls Police arrived, paramedics said they had found what appeared to be pipe bombs in Dougherty\xE2\x80\x99s home, located at 1116 Washington Avenue, according to Falls Police Lt. Steve Guldeman.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Summit County sheriffs, the Summit County Bomb Squad and ATF agents responded to the scene and cordoned off the area.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Once the bomb squad removed the makeshift explosives, \xE2\x80\x9C(Cuyahoga Falls) patrol officers and detectives executed a search warrant at the residence.

                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; New Hampshire health officials hoping to learn from the kind of drug diversion debacle facing Exeter Hospital got some detailed advice Thursday from out-of-state hospitals that have weathered similar incidents.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The New Hampshire Hospital Association invited officials from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and Rose Medical Center in Denver, Colo., to share how they responded to drug diversion problems at their facilities.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In Minnesota, a nurse at a Mayo hospital in Mankato was accused in 2008 of stealing the powerful painkiller fentanyl and replacing it with syringes of saline solution, depriving surgical patients of their medication. In Denver, a former surgical technician is serving a 30-year sentence after pleading guilty in 2009 to similar allegations. Kristen Diane Parker, who got another job at a second Colorado hospital less than two weeks after being fired from Rose Medical Center, was also accused of infecting up to three dozen patients with hepatitis C through her drug diversion.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The Colorado case bears some similarity to the case of David Kwiatkowski, a former cardiac catheterization lab worker who is accused of stealing drugs from Exeter Hospital and replacing them with tainted syringes that were later used on patients. Thirty-two people have been diagnosed with the same strain of hepatitis C he carries since the investigation began in May.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Kevin Dillon, director of pharmacy services at the Mayo Clinic, said responding to such incidents requires a consistent, managed approach. Mayo now has a medical diversion prevention coordinator position as well as an eight-member team that meets within 24 hours of hearing about a suspected drug diversion case.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t react to each one of these as if they&rsquo;re a new thing,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>After the 2008 incident, Dillon said Mayo performed a detailed analysis to identify risk points &mdash; medication being left unattended, for example &mdash; and came up with more than 100 changes it could make. It also developed a list of 77 core structures and processes that it is working to implement in all its facilities. Even when that is done, drug diversion will still occur, he said, but the changes will make it harder.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;When it comes to diverters, &lsquo;They&rsquo;re smart, we&rsquo;re smart, they&rsquo;re desperate, we&rsquo;re not,'&rsquo;&rsquo; he said, quoting a colleague. &lsquo;&lsquo;So eventually we hope they slip up and we do catch them.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>David Theil, an anesthesiologist at Rose Medical Center, said before the 2009 incident there, anesthesiologists frequently filled syringes for multiple patients to be better prepared before procedures.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;You were looked at poorly if you waited until the patient came in the room,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>It was an uphill battle to get those workers to accept changes made after the incident to ensure that medication wasn&rsquo;t withdrawn from dispensing machines until right before a procedure, he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In addition to strengthening its hiring procedures and making other changes, the hospital also has tried to enact broader cultural changes, said Robert Campbell, vice president of operations. Every staff meeting starts with a &lsquo;&lsquo;safety moment&rsquo;&rsquo; to discuss ways to improve patient safety, he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>After the 2009 incident, &lsquo;&lsquo;There were many feelings of guilt, of how could this have happened? How could I have allowed this vulnerability and how could I have potentially hurt somebody?&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;&lsquo;Quickly, we really had to get over that and say, it&rsquo;s really not about me, it&rsquo;s about the patients.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Since Kwiatkowski&rsquo;s arrest in July, Exeter Hospital has been hit with numerous lawsuits and the prospect of losing its Medicare funding if it doesn&rsquo;t fix problems uncovered during a federal inspection trigged by the outbreak of hepatitis C, a blood-borne viral infection that can cause liver disease and chronic health issues. It also has been wrangling with state public health officials over whether it has to release detailed medical records the state is seeking as part of its investigation.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="">
    <p>Kwiatkowski has pleaded not guilty to stealing drugs and tampering with needles.<img alt="end of story marker" border="0" height="8" width="6" src="http://www.boston.com/r/SysConfig/WebPortal/Boston/Framework/images/site_graphics/dingbat_story_end_icon.gif" class="storyend"></p>

    					<p class="byline"><p class="byline">By Sarah N. Mattero and Martin Finucane, Globe Correspondent Globe Staff</p></p>
    					<p>A small plane crashed this afternoon on Interstate 93 in Hooksett, N.H., killing two people, New Hampshire State Police said.</p>
    <p>The Beechcraft Bonanza with two on board crashed between Exits 10 and 11. It was registered to a Rhode Island architectural firm. The Federal Aviation Administration was headed to the scene, the FAA said in a statement.</p>
    <p>New Hampshire Department of Transportation spokesman Bill Boynton said that reports of the crash were received at about 1:15 p.m. The crash happened just south of the I-93/I-293 split, at mile marker 26.2, he said. </p>
    <p>The plane, which had left Nashua, N.H., and was en route to Laconia, N.H., came to rest next to a guardrail after it struck a light pole adjacent to the highway which caused the plane to nose dive, a preliminary investigation found, State Police said. </p>
    <p>A man and a woman were in the plane; their names were not immediately released. State Police said the man was ejected from the aircraft.</p>
    <p>A Globe employee who was driving up I-93 North saw the wreckage at about 1:10 p.m. She said she saw a small plane on the left side of the road.</p>
    <p>The tail of the plane was in the road. The section of the road at that point has three lanes. There was no fire and no smoke, Barbara Gibson said. Emergency vehicles raced past, on the way to the plane. </p>
    <p>Before emergency vehicles arrived, Gibson said she saw two men in suits standing by the plane, including one who looked like New Hampshire Governor John Lynch. His press secretary, Colin Manning, later confirmed that Lynch had been returning from a funeral in Salem, saw the wreck, and waited there until help arrived. </p>
    <p>State Police said the ramp from I-93 North to I-293 South was closed and two of the I-93 North lanes were closed.</p>
    <p>Boynton said drivers should expect traffic delays throughout the afternoon and suggested that people seek alternate routes.</p>
    <p>The incident is under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board, FAA, and the state Bureau of Aeronautics.</p>

    <p>All of us\xE2\x80\x94adults, teens and children\xE2\x80\x94enjoy a scary chill.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>And what better time of year than Halloween\xC2\xA0to indulge in stories that make our spines tingle?\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>It's the perfect time\xC2\xA0for your family to share some spooky stories each evening. To get you started, here are some Halloween books filled with ghosts and ghouls, wizards and witches, haunted houses and black magic that everyone can enjoy together.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    &#13;\n\
    </p><p>Children ages 2-6 love the fun of Halloween: costumes, trick-or-treating and gentle tales of ghosts and goblins. Here are some books for this age group:</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ul><li><strong>\"Ghosts in the House\" by\xC2\xA0Kazuno Kohara\xE2\x80\x94</strong>There are fuzzy pumpkin costumes in sizes as small as 6 months, so why not a Halloween board book for toddlers? This one tells the tale of a little girl who moves into a new house only to discover it is haunted.\xC2\xA0No worries.\xC2\xA0Turns out she\xE2\x80\x99s a witch, and she knows exactly what to do. In a twist on the sheet-as-ghost costume, our little witch gathers the pesky ghosts, puts them in the washing machine, hangs them on the line, and makes bed sheets out of them.\xC2\xA0Stylishly illustrated in orange and black, this story has just right balance for very young children. (Ages 1-6)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>\"Go Away, Big Green Monster!\" by\xC2\xA0Ed Emberley</strong>\xE2\x80\x94This big-faced monster has two yellow eyes, a long blue nose, sharp white teeth, two little squiggly ears, scraggly purple hair and a scary green face. (Ages 3-6)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>\"The Little Old Lady Who Was Not Afraid of Anything\" by Linda Williams; Illustrated by Megan Lloyd</strong>\xE2\x80\x94In this cumulative story that will have everyone chiming in on the telling, we watch an unflappable little old lady encounter two clomping shoes, a wiggling pair of pants, a shaking shirt, two clapping gloves, a nodding hat and one scary pumpkin head that says, \xE2\x80\x9CBOO, BOO!\xE2\x80\x9D (Ages 3-7)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>\"The Monster Returns\" by\xC2\xA0Peter McCarty</strong>\xE2\x80\x94When the phone rings and Jeremy\xE2\x80\x99s blue monster announces that he is bored and coming back, Jeremy invites his friends over to draw their own monsters. Then, when Jeremy\xE2\x80\x99s monster arrives, he is greeted by a roomful of friends. And friends are just what the monster\xC2\xA0and<i>\xC2\xA0</i>Jeremy need! (Ages 3-7)</li>&#13;\n\
    </ul><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><ul><li><strong>\"Night of the Pumpkinheads\" by\xC2\xA0Michael J. Rosen; illustrated by Hugh McMahon</strong>\xE2\x80\x94All those pumpkins sitting on the porch want their turn to put on costumes and go trick-or-treating.\xC2\xA0And this year, they have their chance!

(Ages 6-9)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>\"Earwig and the Witch\" by\xC2\xA0Diana Wynne Jones; Illustrated by Paul O. Zelinsky</strong>\xE2\x80\x94Earwig was left in a basket on the doorstep of St. Morwald\xE2\x80\x99s Home for Children with a note suggesting she had been left there by a witch. Earwig is happy at St. Morwald\xE2\x80\x99s. Why not?\xC2\xA0 She uses her \xE2\x80\x9Cstrange abilities\xE2\x80\x9D to get whatever she wants\xE2\x80\x94from her favorite lunch to a new red sweater\xE2\x80\x94until she meets her matches in Bella Yaga and the Mandrake, who adopt her.\xC2\xA0 Her new home is strange to be sure: rooms change boundaries, smells and sights appear and disappear, and Thomas, the black cat, can talk. But Earwig is determined to take control, and she and Thomas begin to work some magic of their own. (Ages 7-10)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>\"Dragonbreath: Curse of the Were-Wiener\" and\xC2\xA0other books in the Dragonbreath series\xC2\xA0by Ursula Vernon</strong>\xE2\x80\x94Just as Danny\xE2\x80\x99s best friend Wendell the Iguana is about to bite into a hot dog, the hot dog bites back!

    <p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Good morning and welcome to Thursday! Another beautiful fall week is coming to a close; I hope you\xE2\x80\x99ve been getting out and enjoying the mild temperatures and colorful leaves \xE2\x80\x93 though not as colorful as I would like, I have to say. Does it seem a little duller to you this year? It does to me.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>One thing I love about the fall is the start of the theater season, and we\xE2\x80\x99re lucky to be swimming in it here in town. For starters, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.concordplayers.org\">The Concord Players</a> open their season with a Tony-award-winner, . This was also a movie starring Henry Fonda, James Cagney and William Powell, among others. All the action takes place aboard a cargo vessel in the South Pacific during WWII. The set alone is reason enough to see this show: Carlisle resident Allen Bantly has designed and built an amazing replica of a ship. One side shows the deck, and when it miraculously turns on a turntable built onto the stage, you\xE2\x80\x99re in one of the bunkrooms. It\xE2\x80\x99s an engineering feat.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The play is based on a book of short stories by real-life sailor Thomas Heggen, describing his exploits on the USS Virgo in the 1940s. It\xE2\x80\x99s a group of bored and randy sailors longing for shore leave, their tyrannical captain and the one man, Mister Roberts, who risks it all to make it possible. It\xE2\x80\x99s hilarious, and the cast includes a number of guys who have graced this stage before: Gordie Ellis, John Alzapiedi Craig Howard, Jay Newlon and Chuck Holleman, among others.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>At $20 a ticket, this is the best bang for your buck you can get for live theater, and if you really want to have a total night out, come opening night, when they serve appetizers and drinks. It\xE2\x80\x99s a whole lot of fun, I\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you. I plan to be there!</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The show opens next Friday, Nov. 2, at 8 p.m., and runs for three weekends, through Nov. 17. For all the good details, including how and where to order your tickets, go to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.concordplayers.org\">www.concordplayers.org</a> and click on Tickets. And go support our local theater!</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b><i>Let\xE2\x80\x99s Do the Time Warp Again!<br></i></b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Halloween is coming up fast and furious, that night when ghosts, goblins and Lady Gaga roam the streets demanding free candy. And what better way to celebrate than with a showing of <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.facebook.com%2frockyhorrorshow\">Richard O\xE2\x80\x99Brien\xE2\x80\x99s Rocky Horror Show</a>. Yes, I discovered that this is playing on stage over at <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.emersonumbrella.org%2f\">Emerson Umbrella</a> \xE2\x80\x93 to my horror, I had no idea they staged theatrical productions of this nature over at our venerable art studio.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>And yes, it\xE2\x80\x99s theater, not the movie, so live people will be performing this cult classic.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>For those of you not in the know, this wacky musical tells the story on an engaged couple who get caught in a storm and find themselves at the home of a mad transvestite scientist getting ready to unveil his new creation, a muscle man named Rocky Horror.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A number of the cast were part of the production in 2010, for which the Umbrella won a DASH award, meaning they are very talented and won\xE2\x80\x99t disappoint. The show opens tomorrow night, Oct. 26, at 8 p.m., and runs through Nov. 3 \xE2\x80\x93 Saturdays will have two shows, at 7 and 10 p.m. There will even be special Halloween performances on Tuesday and Wednesday, Oct. 30 and 31, at 8 p.m. Sounds like a rollicking good time! For all the good info on tickets and such, click <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.emersonumbrella.org%2ftheater%2f2012-fall-productions%2f\">here</a>; if you already know you want to buy tickets, click <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ticketstage.com%2fbin%2ff.wk%3fts.admin.homepage.gen%2b%40THEATER%3dEUCA\">here</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>This Saturday, Oct. 27 <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fsaveourheritage.com%2f\">Save Our Heritage</a> and <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2flistings%2fminute-man-national-historical-park\">Minute Man National Historical Park</a> are holding an event to celebrate the completion of the Save Our Heritage restoration of Barrett Farm, and the transfer of its ownership to the National Park Service, Minute Man National Historical Park.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A public ceremony with U.S. Rep Niki Tsongas and others will take place at Barrett Farm, 448 Barretts Mill Road, at 11 a.m., followed by an Open House from noon to 4 p.m.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Restoration of the historic Barrett House, built in 1705, began eight years ago when Save Our Heritage (SOH), a Concord-based nonprofit preservation organization, acquired Barrett Farm and the 3.4 acres of surrounding land from the McGrath family.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CIt was a collaborative effort right from the start between Save Our Heritage, the Town, the Park, and the McGraths,\xE2\x80\x9D said Neil Rasmussen, president of SOH.\xC2\xA0 \xE2\x80\x9COur shared goal was to have Save Our Heritage restore the Col. James Barrett House to the way it was during Revolutionary times, and to eventually incorporate it into Minute Man Park so that visitors could experience it as living history. And that time has finally come.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Col. James Barrett Farm is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as one of the most important Revolutionary War landmarks of national significance. Col. James Barrett, a member of the Provincial Congress, was the senior officer and overall field commander at the North Bridge in the first battle of the American Revolution. He was also in charge of all the supplies in the area, enough for an army of 15,000. When the British Regulars marched to Concord on April 19, 1775, they were intent on seizing weapons and other military supplies stored throughout the town, including a major stockpile on Colonel Barrett\xE2\x80\x99s property.\xC2\xA0The farm and the Barrett family provide a central link to the story of \xE2\x80\x9Cthe shot heard \xE2\x80\x98round the world.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Barrett property has been farmed continuously from Colonial times to the present, and has been owned by only two families over the past 300 years -- the Barretts for 200 of those years, and the McGraths for 100. Michael McGrath now resides in a house behind the Col. James Barrett house, and his late brother Patrick farmed the surrounding land and ran the McGrath Farmstand across the road.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Since 2004, the exterior restoration of Barrett House has seen the stabilization of the back wall; completion of a new wood roof; application of hand-skived pine clapboards; and the installation of handmade replications of the original 1770\xE2\x80\x99s doors and faithful reproductions of the original window frames and sash.\xC2\xA0In addition, archaeological studies were conducted, and the land behind the house was cleared to reveal a more open agrarian landscape. Painstaking restoration and preservation of the interior of the house has included stabilizing of original plaster walls; repointing of fireboxes; and the restoration of wood paneling and floors.\xC2\xA0In addition, careful paint conservation techniques have revealed many original and exceedingly rare colonial paint surfaces.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CMuch of our restoration work employed methods and materials used in the 18th century, wherever possible,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jim Cunningham, the project manager forSOH-Barrett Farm.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The wood used to stabilize the post and beam structure was hand-hewn by traditional timber framers, and wrought iron reproduction hardware was fashioned by Concord\xE2\x80\x99s local blacksmith, Carl Close. As a result of this meticulous attention to details, when visitors enter the house, they are transported to Revolutionary times and can sense a direct, living, tangible link to the beginning of our nation.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>This eight-year restoration project was generously funded by four CPA grants from the town of Concord, a Save America\xE2\x80\x99s Treasures grant from the Department of the Interior, and numerous private donations. Many town departments and committees have provided critical assistance and dozens of volunteers and organizations, including the Boy Scouts, have donated their time and effort to the project.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CRestoring Barrett Farm was only one part of the preservation effort. Getting it incorporated into Minute Man National Historical Park was the other part, and this involved a three-part process at the federal level spanning several years,\xE2\x80\x9D said Anna West Winter, executive director of SOH. \xE2\x80\x9CIn 2005, the late Senator Edward Kennedy and former Representative Marty Meehan lent their energetic support to sponsoring legislation to facilitate a feasibility study of the farm's inclusion in the Park.\xC2\xA0 Later,\xE2\x80\x9D Winter adds, \xE2\x80\x9Cin 2009, thanks to the steadfast leadership of Congresswoman Niki Tsongas, Minute Man Park\xE2\x80\x99s boundaries were expanded by Congressional legislation to include the Col. James Barrett House and additional surrounding acres.\xE2\x80\x9D\xC2\xA0Finally, this year Congress appropriated the funds needed for the National Park Service to acquire Barrett House and the surrounding land.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CWe\xE2\x80\x99re delighted to finally have the Col. James Barrett House incorporated into Minute Man National Historical Park,\xE2\x80\x9D stated the Park\xE2\x80\x99s Supertintendent, Nancy Nelson.\xC2\xA0 \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s something we have been looking forward to for a long time. Barrett Farm completes the narrative of the beginning of the American Revolution within the Park.\xE2\x80\x9D\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Barrett Farm Celebration on October 27 at 11:00 a.m. will be held outside on the lawn, rain or shine at 448 Barretts Mill Road.\xC2\xA0</p>\n\

                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; New Hampshire health officials hoping to learn from the kind of drug diversion debacle facing Exeter Hospital got some detailed advice Thursday from out-of-state hospitals that have weathered similar incidents.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The New Hampshire Hospital Association invited officials from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and Rose Medical Center in Denver, Colo., to share how they responded to drug diversion problems at their facilities.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In Minnesota, a nurse at a Mayo hospital in Mankato was accused in 2008 of stealing the powerful painkiller fentanyl and replacing it with syringes of saline solution, depriving surgical patients of their medication. In Denver, a former surgical technician is serving a 30-year sentence after pleading guilty in 2009 to similar allegations. Kristen Diane Parker, who got another job at a second Colorado hospital less than two weeks after being fired from Rose Medical Center, was also accused of infecting up to three dozen patients with hepatitis C through her drug diversion.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The Colorado case bears some similarity to the case of David Kwiatkowski, a former cardiac catheterization lab worker who is accused of stealing drugs from Exeter Hospital and replacing them with tainted syringes that were later used on patients. Thirty-two people have been diagnosed with the same strain of hepatitis C he carries since the investigation began in May.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Kevin Dillon, director of pharmacy services at the Mayo Clinic, said responding to such incidents requires a consistent, managed approach. Mayo now has a medical diversion prevention coordinator position as well as an eight-member team that meets within 24 hours of hearing about a suspected drug diversion case.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t react to each one of these as if they&rsquo;re a new thing,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>After the 2008 incident, Dillon said Mayo performed a detailed analysis to identify risk points &mdash; medication being left unattended, for example &mdash; and came up with more than 100 changes it could make. It also developed a list of 77 core structures and processes that it is working to implement in all its facilities. Even when that is done, drug diversion will still occur, he said, but the changes will make it harder.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;When it comes to diverters, &lsquo;They&rsquo;re smart, we&rsquo;re smart, they&rsquo;re desperate, we&rsquo;re not,'&rsquo;&rsquo; he said, quoting a colleague. &lsquo;&lsquo;So eventually we hope they slip up and we do catch them.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>David Theil, an anesthesiologist at Rose Medical Center, said before the 2009 incident there, anesthesiologists frequently filled syringes for multiple patients to be better prepared before procedures.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;You were looked at poorly if you waited until the patient came in the room,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>It was an uphill battle to get those workers to accept changes made after the incident to ensure that medication wasn&rsquo;t withdrawn from dispensing machines until right before a procedure, he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In addition to strengthening its hiring procedures and making other changes, the hospital also has tried to enact broader cultural changes, said Robert Campbell, vice president of operations. Every staff meeting starts with a &lsquo;&lsquo;safety moment&rsquo;&rsquo; to discuss ways to improve patient safety, he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>After the 2009 incident, &lsquo;&lsquo;There were many feelings of guilt, of how could this have happened? How could I have allowed this vulnerability and how could I have potentially hurt somebody?&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;&lsquo;Quickly, we really had to get over that and say, it&rsquo;s really not about me, it&rsquo;s about the patients.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Since Kwiatkowski&rsquo;s arrest in July, Exeter Hospital has been hit with numerous lawsuits and the prospect of losing its Medicare funding if it doesn&rsquo;t fix problems uncovered during a federal inspection trigged by the outbreak of hepatitis C, a blood-borne viral infection that can cause liver disease and chronic health issues. It also has been wrangling with state public health officials over whether it has to release detailed medical records the state is seeking as part of its investigation.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="">
    <p>Kwiatkowski has pleaded not guilty to stealing drugs and tampering with needles.<img alt="end of story marker" border="0" height="8" width="6" src="http://www.boston.com/r/SysConfig/WebPortal/Boston/Framework/images/site_graphics/dingbat_story_end_icon.gif" class="storyend"></p>

    <p>The evening was cold and rainy and the local high school football team was playing its neighboring rival. But the Republican presidential ticket of Romney and Ryan drew a huge crowd to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fnorthcanton.patch.com%2flistings%2fhoover-high-school\">Hoover High School</a> Friday night.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Gov. Mitt Romney campaigned in\xC2\xA0Iowa\xC2\xA0and\xC2\xA0Ohio Friday\xC2\xA0as national polls showed a tightening presidential race. <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpoliticalticker.blogs.cnn.com%2f2012%2f10%2f26%2fcnn-poll-obama-50-romney-46-in-ohio%2f\">A CNN poll on Friday showed</a> Obama leading by 4 percentage points in Ohio.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>With the race seeming to be narrowing here, rally-goers at Hoover High School said on Friday that this presidential contest was getting exciting and very watchable.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"I think this is the most excited I've seen people ever,\" said Lauren Zink of Jackson Township. \"It's good. I think it should continue like this. I\xC2\xA0think this is probably the biggest election we've had since ... I've been voting.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Megan Murphy of Canton said with the race so close, the election takes on even more significance. She was glad to attend Friday's rally -- even if the weather was miserable.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"It's so close and so historic,\" Murphy said. \"I don't think it's smart to miss anything like this.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Romney came onstage at about 8:15 p.m. and started off by attacking Obama's health care reform plan.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Romney told the crowd that\xC2\xA0the president has chosen to make election about Sesame Street characters and word games.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"The Obama\xC2\xA0campaign is out of ideas and out of excuses,\" Romney said. \"That's why, come November, you're going to make sure he's out of office.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Romney said that while he has no plans to cut the military, Obama will.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Romney also said he will \"get economy going\" by taking advantage of energy resources and opening new trade with other nations.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"I'll lower tax rates on small businesses,\" Romney said. \"Unlike the current administration, I like business because I like the jobs that business creates.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>His running mate, Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan, came on stage with his wife and children.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"We need leadership. We need a leader to run at these problems and fix these problems in Washington,\" Ryan said. \"And that is Mitt Romney.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Ryan said the presdient is \"dividing, trying to win an election by default.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Think about how we would feel if Obama were elected,\" Ryan said. \"We would have another four years like the last four years.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Several speakers took the stage to whip up the crowd before the GOP main event.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Patricia Heaton, Cleveland-area native and star of the television show \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" introduced Romney and Ryan.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"You know what Cleveland's motto is? At least we're not Akron,\" Heaton told the crowd. \"But after driving through your beautiful city it should be 'We wish we were Canton.'</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"We have the opportunity to vote for someone who, as governor, brought both parties together and turned a deficit into a surplus,\" Heaton said of Romney before introducing Ryan.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, running for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Sherrod Brown, said, \"The only way we're going to change Washington is by changing the people we send there.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci, also up for elections in District 16, gots boos while talking about Brown and cheers when mentioning Mandel.\xC2\xA0U.S. Rep. Bob Gibbs, who is seeking election to District 18, predicted that the president will get the pink slip in 11 days.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Friday's rally, which was attended by thousands, was the second or third GOP political appearance that Bruce Hein and his wife have attended in recent weeks.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Canton couple said they both planned to vote for the Romney ticket.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Marge Hein said the country needs a president with good business sense. \"Obama's not doing anything,\" she said.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Economy policy and the federal budget also was influencing Zink's vote. \"We cannot be in debt by trillions of dollars,\" she said. \"A new direction is what we need.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Rally-goers began to fill the high school baseball field around 5 p.m. as dusk fell on the chilly, rainy day. The line to enter the event wrapped around the entire baseball field and down an adjoining side street.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A stage was set up in the middle of the Hoover High School baseball field, faced by the stadium seats. The Oak Ridge Boys performed before the speakers got under way.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The event came on an evening with another must-watch contest that captured the attention of North Canton residents. But this battle played out on a football field: the Hoover High Vikings were set to play their neighboring rivals, the Jackson Polar Bears.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p>\n\

    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; A registered nurse who police say told them she killed her brother-in-law with medication she took home by mistake has had her license suspended by the state Board of Nursing.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Catherine George went to police in Derry on Oct. 14 and said she had killed her 55-year-old brother-in-law, Randall Percival, by giving him 300 units of insulin, the state attorney general&rsquo;s office says.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>George gave police a large syringe and a glass vial of insulin and told them Percival &lsquo;&lsquo;didn&rsquo;t need to suffer anymore,&rsquo;&rsquo; the nursing board said Wednesday in an email.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>George, when asked how she got the insulin, said she took it home from work by mistake in July and forgot to return it, the nursing board said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Percival, who lived in Raymond, died Oct. 9. Police couldn&rsquo;t comment on how Percival might have been suffering or on anything else, and they referred questions to the attorney general&rsquo;s office.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>A criminal investigation into Percival&rsquo;s death is ongoing, and the nursing board said it was unknown what, if any, charges might be filed.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The nursing board issued an emergency suspension of George&rsquo;s license on Tuesday, saying it had received information indicating her continued practice of nursing posed &lsquo;&lsquo;an imminent threat to public health, safety and/or welfare.&rsquo;&rsquo; It scheduled a hearing for Nov. 2 to determine if the suspension should continue or if permanent disciplinary sanctions should be imposed.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="">
    <p>George, who was first granted her nursing license in 1994, couldn&rsquo;t be reached for comment on Wednesday.

                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>EXETER, N.H. (AP) &mdash; New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called on New Hampshire voters to support fellow Republican Ovide LaMontagne in the race for governor and described challenger Maggie Hassan as a &lsquo;&lsquo;New Jersey Democrat.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The famously outspoken Christie was the headliner for a night of stump speeches in front of a standing-room only crowd of about 300 at the Old Town Hall on Wednesday.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Former Republican governors of New Hampshire, John Sununu, Craig Benson, and Stephen Merrill, delivered brief opening remarks, and all reminded the crowd that the race for president and governor are very close and only 13 days remained to convince undecided voters.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>LaMontagne fired up the crowd by criticizing Hassan&rsquo;s tax policies and accused her of trying to get voters to take their &lsquo;&lsquo;eyes off the ball.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>He implored the audience to tell their friends, families, and co-workers what the race is all about.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;This race is about jobs, the economy, and lowering taxes,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Introducing Christie, La Montagne said &lsquo;&lsquo;The states that are doing the best right now are the ones that are led by Republican governors.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Christie, the first-term New Jersey governor, had spent the day in Massachusetts campaigning for U.S. Sen. Scott Brown. He brought the crowd to its feet as soon as he entered the hall.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;New Jersey has lived the horror film that your lives will become if you elect Maggie Hassan,&rsquo;&rsquo; Christie said. &lsquo;&lsquo;She&rsquo;s a New Jersey Democrat.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Christie criticized Hassan&rsquo;s opposition of an amendment to the state constitution to ban income tax.  He then described how, in 1976, New Jersey instituted a state income tax of 2 percent.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Today, it is 9 percent and New Jersey has the third highest income tax in the country,&rsquo;&rsquo; Christie said. &lsquo;&lsquo;Ovide will make sure, with every ounce of energy he has, that that will not happen in New Hampshire.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Christie had the crowd laughing a number of times, but also delivered a long and impassioned plea for support.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Echoing previous speakers, he reminded the audience that less than two weeks remained to get the Republican message out before the election.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;New Hampshire doesn&rsquo;t want to be known as another failed liberal experiment,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;&lsquo;When people say that politicians are all the same, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter who you vote for, that&rsquo;s the lazy, easy, response. Governors matter. They become the spiritual leaders of the state.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>As an example, Christie recalled polls from just before he took office that showed 19 percent of his constituents approved of the direction New Jersey was going.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Today, it&rsquo;s 54 percent,&rsquo;&rsquo; the governor said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s more than just a vote. You are part of a movement to change history in New Hampshire.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Earlier Wednesday, the president of the national Planned Parenthood Action Fund called Hassan a champion for women&rsquo;s right to make their own health decisions.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Cecile Richards told reporters at a news conference Wednesday the stakes for women are high in this election.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Hassan was asked about a comment made by Indiana Senate candidate Richard Mourdock, who said that when a woman becomes pregnant during a rape, &lsquo;&lsquo;that&rsquo;s something God intended.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Hassan said a group of candidates are running for office who believe women can&rsquo;t be trusted to make their own health care decisions. Hassan argues rival Lamontagne is too extreme because he supports limiting abortion and employer paid coverage of contraceptives.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="">

    <p>The Massachusetts School Building Authority will reinstate funding for the troubled Concord-Carlisle High School building project, state Representative Cory Atkins announced Wednesday. The state suspended $28.8 million worth of grant payments for the district&rsquo;s $92.6 million high school project in June, saying that the project had ballooned over budget and scope. At one point this past spring, the project was poised to run between $15 million and $17 million over its construction budget. Costs have since been reined in, and the project is back on track, according to school officials.

    </p><p>The  restored funding comes with stipulations that the MSBA will formally  present in a letter to the district in the next couple of weeks. Many  of the  stipulations focus on the problems caused by miscommunication. The  district will now be required to have a clear communication plan and to  submit monthly progress reports to the MSBA that will be assessable to  the public.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Representative  Atkins is delighted that funding will be restored and that the project  will move forward. \xE2\x80\x9CIt was extremely helpful to me during the  negotiations  that this project has almost universal support in my communities,\xE2\x80\x9D said  Atkins.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Conflict  in Concord arose when members of the community questioned whether they  would get the school they voted for.\xC2\xA0 From now on, any and all  modifications  will be clearly communicated to the public after being approved by the  MSBA.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>The group will meet monthly to discuss pending legislation and other issues of interest. The purpose of this group will be to ensure that, if Michael Benn wins the election on Nov. 6, Democrats will have a seat at the table.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CAs the election gets closer, I am finding that a lot of lifelong Democrats are receptive to my candidacy and willing to support me,\" said Benn. \"I always believed that my common-sense message of fiscal responsibility, balance, and bi-partisanship would have crossover appeal to Independents and Democrats, but I am still amazed by the vast support that I am getting from Democrats who are ready to put party aside and vote for a new vision for the district and the Commonwealth.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Because of the broad, bi-partisan support Benn is receiving, there is a high probability that he will win the State Representative seat in November. He came up with the idea of forming this advisory panel because he realizes that his victory would only be possible with the common support of Republicans, Independents, and Democrats.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Benn is committed to representing everyone in the district,this means carefully considering both sides of every issue.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CI am a principled common-sense conservative, and have been able to find common-ground with many long-time Democrats in the area,\" he said. \"While there are areas of politics where we may disagree, it is clear that we can work together to solve our current fiscal crisis and bring in a new era of bi-partisanship.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Michael Benn is a candidate for State Representative of Massachusetts Fourteenth Middlesex District which includes the towns of Concord, Carlisle, Acton (precincts 1, 2, and 6), and Chelmsford (precincts 1 and 9). He is a lifelong resident of Concord with a BS from Northeastern University, and an MBA from Boston University. He has worked in the private sector, in the field of healthcare finance for the past 24 years.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Benn is running for this seat because his real-world problem-solving experience is needed on Beacon Hill now, more than ever. He will approach every problem from the perspective of the taxpayer, businessperson, student, and parent, not as a government bureaucrat. Benn has the skills necessary to be an exceptional Legislator, one of whom we can be proud.</p></div></div>"

There are \xC2\xA0research studies open for almost any kind of cancer at any given time.\xC2\xA0 If a study is not available for a particular patient, the Cancer Research Program will investigate finding one for the patient.\xC2\xA0 All of the cancer research studies conducted at Summa Health System are Medicare approved clinical trials and therefore, covered by Medicare and other insurance providers.</p>\n\
    <p><a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.summahealthcare1.org%2fwomenshealth%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f10%2f120210148.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2709\" title=\"120210148\" src=\"http://www.summahealthcare1.org/womenshealth/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/120210148.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\"></a></p>\n\
    <p>When a patient enrolls in a clinical trial physicians, researchers and staff follow their treatment closely.\xC2\xA0 Each patient has a clinical research nurse who coordinates their care according to the research study.\xC2\xA0 The research nurse documents any side effects and response to the treatment.\xC2\xA0 Data is collected about the patient\xE2\x80\x99s treatment and the data is entered into an electronic database or data form for submission to the study sponsor.\xC2\xA0The data submitted does not include information that specifically identifies the patient. The physicians at Summa who are treating patients on a clinical trial are updated on a regular basis about the research study and its outcomes.</p>\n\
    <p>Clinical trials for cancer therapies typically assign research participants to receive either the standard therapy currently available or standard therapy plus an experimental product or intervention. \xC2\xA0Participating in a research study typically costs the patient the same amount as standard medical care, yet experimental therapies and additional tests, if needed, are paid for by the sponsor. Discuss with your physician if a clinical trial is right for you, or your loved ones.

    </p><blockquote>&#13;\n\
    <p>As a piece of energy rotates in around that buckling jet stream, just at  the right time across the eastern U.S., Sandy may actually phase with  that upper-level energy and move back toward the coast.\xC2\xA0As this occurs,  Sandy, turns into more of a massive Nor\xE2\x80\x99easter, provides an expanding  wind and rain field that produces damaging gusts, flooding rains and  coastal flooding over parts of the mid-Atlantic and/or New England  anywhere in the Monday-Tuesday timeframe.\xC2\xA0This scenario is now more  likely, and over the next few days, we will be ironing out the details.  Although, the timing of all these ingredients coming together has to be  precise, so there is still a chance of a miss to the east, but that  chance has lowered.</p>&#13;\n\
    </blockquote><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The scenario mentioned above, Lambert continues, would mean winds in the 50-60mph range, with hurricane force (74mph-plus) gusts at the coast, beach erosion, both coastal and inland flooding from torrential rain, and widespread power outages due to wind and downed tree branches.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>If Sandy's path shifts into the Mid-Atlantic states or further north into the Maritimes, Lambert reports, the impact in this area would be much less severe.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The exact impact of Sandy remains unknown, but it's not too early to prepare. The Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency offers <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.mass.gov%2feopss%2fhome-sec-emerg-resp%2fplan-prep%2fnatural-hazards%2fhurricanes%2fmema-offers-hurricane-preparedness-tips.html\">these hurricane preparedness tips</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\

  title: Kentucky's freshmen mesh well in scrimmage
  community_id: "30"

    <div><div id="articleFull"><p><span class="articleBegin">L</span>EXINGTON, Ky. &mdash; There were many moments during Wednesday night&rsquo;s Blue-White scrimmage where Kentucky&rsquo;s freshmen justified the lofty expectations placed upon them.</p>
    <p>Archie Goodwin showed some flash while scoring a game-high 32 points. Willie Cauley-Stein was a formidable post presence with 14 points and 12 rebounds.</p>
    <p>Swingman Alex Poythress added 25 points with quickness and athleticism.</p>
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>A sore back slowed highly touted forward Nerlens Noel, but the point was seeing how this foursome played together and with others in their first competitive appearance before the Wildcats faithful. Early returns were encouraging, as they contributed to both teams in a game won by the Blue 89-88.</p>
    <p>However, the bottom line is meeting John Calipari&rsquo;s high standards and the Wildcats coach quickly noted that this is a work in progress.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;We have a way to go,&rdquo; Calipari said afterward. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t rebound, we don&rsquo;t scramble. Other than that, we&rsquo;re a pretty good team.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Calipari was kidding, noting replacing six players from last season&rsquo;s national championship team would lead to some falloff. Kentucky had scrimmaged just 12 minutes before Wednesday because he has spent much of fall practice teaching his young squad fundamentals.</p>
    <p>That showed with a lack of defense.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to take a lot more talking on defense and just executing on the defensive schemes more than we have been,&rdquo; Goodwin said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re still learning, so we&rsquo;ll continue to practice on it. We&rsquo;ll get better and better every day we practice it as long as we work hard.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>At the same time, some nice combinations emerged thanks to newcomers such as transfer Julius Mays, a graduate student who played last season for Wright State.</p>
    <p>He displayed good speed and ball movement along with a nice outside shot for the Blue squad. The highlight of his 13-point game was a fadeaway 3-pointer as the shot clock expired, which looked more planned than hurried.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just trying to find my game,&rdquo; Mays said. &ldquo;I just want to do whatever it is this team needs me to do, whether that&rsquo;s scoring or coming in and creating for others or distributing the ball, or even if it&rsquo;s coming in and getting greedy on the defensive end. I&rsquo;m willing to do whatever it takes to win.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>He seemed to find chemistry with Cauley-Stein, who fed him for one shot before Mays returned the favor by lobbing a pass to the 7-footer for a dunk to help the Blue team lead 29-17.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Me and Julius are (among) seven players that figure to get a lot of playing time, so we had to go at it like that,&rdquo; Cauley-Stein said.</p>
    <p>Noel finished with nine points on 4-of-7 shooting.</p>
    <p>Among the veterans, Kyle Wiltjer had 28 points, Jon Hood 17 and Jarrod Polson 13. Sophomore Ryan Harrow had 20.</p>

    <p>BOSTON (CBS) &#8211; Women in East Boston are on alert once again, after another woman was attacked not far from the Maverick MBTA stop.</p>\n\
    <p>This latest attack happened shortly after one o&#8217;clock Wednesday morning. A woman walking near the intersection of Meridian and Lexington Streets says she was attacked from behind by a man who pushed her to the ground.</p>\n\
    <p>It&#8217;s a scenario very similar to three other attacks in the area in recent weeks.</p>\n\
    <p>In this most recent incident, a Good Samaritan heard the victim scream and ran across the street to help her out.</p>\n\
    <p>The suspect took off on foot towards Border Street. The victim described him to police as a black man in his late twenties, about 5\xE2\x80\x992\xE2\x80\x9D, stocky, and possibly with a birth mark on his left cheek.\n\

    <p>AKRON, Ohio -- A little sunshine is sure to beam down on either Akron or Central Michigan Saturday as one of them will pull out its first league victory of the dwindling football season. </p>
    <p>Akron (1-7, 0-4 Mid-American Conference) goes into the game against the Chippewas (2-5, 0-3) in Mount Pleasant, Mich., looking for its first road win since Oct. 18, 2008, at Eastern Michigan. That was six wins and four years ago, when J.D. Brookhart was the coach. </p>
    <p>Akron coach Terry Bowden's team is battling mounting injuries -- starting tailback Jawon Chisholm is expected to miss the game with wrist and shoulder injuries -- as it looks for its second victory of the season. Even though Chisholm is out and the Zips' passing game is potent, look for Akron to run the football more. CMU has allowed an average of 234.4 yards per game on the ground, with 20 touchdowns. </p>
    <p>Akron hasn't won since defeating Morgan State, 66-6, in the third game of the season. That was during a stretch in which Akron's offense was humming. Since losing to Miami, 59-46, Akron has posted 10, 28 and seven points. The Zips are sixth in the MAC in scoring and total offense, after leading the conference in both categories just three games ago. </p>
    <p>Yet Akron's passing game remains the best in the MAC. The Zips are averaging 311.5 yards per game through the air, and their 23 touchdown passes lead the league. </p>
    <p>Like Akron, CMU has faced the MAC's top teams so far, with defending MAC champion Northern Illinois a common opponent. The Chippewas lost to NIU, 55-24, while the Zips are coming off a 37-7 setback to the Huskies. </p></p>

It lets a network manager monitor the connection quality for end users, bring visibility to connectivity problems so they can be worked out before they affect devices and programs.</p>                                                <div class="medcity-paid-inline">

    											<p>Ketonen explained that with applications like heart monitors, patient records and nurse call systems rely on wireless LAN networks, these connections should be watched more carefully and more proactively. &#8220;Now that cables aren&#8217;t in place anymore and applications have to rely solely on LAN networks, that&#8217;s not an option and (wireless) has to just work,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Measuring and monitoring the network is one thing that you really have to do.&#8221;</p><p>7signal doesn&#8217;t have your typical startup story. The company formed in Finland in 2006 and came to the U.S. only two years ago in an arrangement made through a collaboration between the city of Akron, Ohio and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.akronaccelerator.com%2f">Helsinski Business and Science Park</a> in Finland. Its U.S. headquarters is housed at the Akron Global Business Accelerator.</p><p>Ketonen, a former program manager at Nokia Systems, said that Finland used to be No. 1 in wireless network technology, but has fallen a bit behind. Electronic medical records and wireless networks are being rolled out in hospitals there, but they don&#8217;t have many applications running on them yet. &#8220;In the U.S., all those things are already there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think there is something like a two- to three-year gap between the markets in Finland and U.S.&#8221;</p><p>For the past two years, the company has been working on getting traction in the U.S. and making a name for itself. In 2011, it tested its software solution at Akron General Medical Center and Akron Children&#8217;s Hospital. With some customers, Ketonen said, it has delivered customers a 100 percent to 300 percent improvement in their network&#8217;s performance.</p><p>For now, 7signal is focused on delivering its solution to hospitals and universities, which have hundreds or even thousands of access points for wireless connectivity. &#8220;Medical and hospitals, that&#8217;s the most critical use of wireless LAN you can think of,&#8221; Ketonen said. &#8220;There are lot of devices there, even doctors&#8217; iPads and iPhones.&#8221;</p><p>The healthcare industry spends a reported <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fmedcitynews.com%2f2012%2f06%2freport-healthcare-spends-9-billion-a-year-and-counting-on-staying-connected%2f">$9 billion a year on staying connected</a>, so the company is targeting a huge market. Another thing working in its favor is <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fmedicalconnectivity.com%2f2008%2f05%2f26%2fiec-80001-an-introduction%2f">ISO 80001</a>, a recently established standard that defines the process and requirements for risk management of medical devices and systems on the IT network.</p><p>&#8220;Instead of leaving it there and hoping it works, that will be far from sufficient in the future,&#8221; Ketonen said. &#8220;Proactivity to remove issues is becoming the standard way of working,&#8221;</p>

  content: "<div><div>\n\
    <p>The focus of Breast Cancer Awareness efforts are focused on women -- the ribbons are pink, after all. But men can get breast cancer too.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Patch sat down with a few local experts about male breast cancer:\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ul>&#13;\n\
    &#13;\n\
    </ul><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Patch:</strong>\xC2\xA0Why is it important to talk about male breast cancer?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong>\xC2\xA0It's important because men don't think they can get breast cancer. They don't think they can receive a mammogram screening. The discussion should be focused on breaking the myths and informing people on what is fact versus fiction. Men will say to me \xE2\x80\x9Cmen can't get breast cancer.\xE2\x80\x9D So they tend to show up late, when the lump has been there for several months, which is usually stage 2 or later. And that means that it has already spread to the lymph nodes because they have been waiting. I see this 50 percent of the time. If they never heard of male breast cancer, they think the lump will go away.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Patch:</strong> How common is breast cancer in men?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Dr. Harris:</strong> Male breast cancer is certainly less common, but it is a significant problem. Out of 100 cases 1 will be in men. The lifetime breast cancer risk rate is 1 in 1,000 for men. The average age is between 50-70 years old. So it is not often seen in younger men.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Patch:</strong>\xC2\xA0Is there a stigma related to male breast cancer?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Dr. Lee:\xC2\xA0</strong>Yes. There may be some stigma as it is widely a women's area. If a man goes to a breast center, it is predominantly female. The physician, the technician that takes the mammogram are mostly all women. So men may feel discomfort.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>However, there are groups that are raising awareness among men. Take the NFL for example. The players, wearing pink socks and the pink ribbons this month, are bringing exposure to a venue that men watch. I think this is sparking a discussion for males. They are having conversations with their wives and girlfriends, and asking questions like \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat is this.\xE2\x80\x9D This generation of awareness is the key, as men usually discover breast cancer when it is advanced. So knowing the issue is essential for survival.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Patch: </strong>What are the symptoms for male breast cancer?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Dr. Harris:</strong> Male breast cancer presents almost always as a lump in the breast. Usually there is an enlargement of the breast tissues, although it is not as dramatic as in women. However, there are men who are at higher risk. High risk patients produce more estrogen than normal. It's interesting because the cancerous tissue is almost always estrogen positive.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>We typically see this in the setting of liver disease, alcoholism, obesity and there is a genetic syndrome Klinefelter. In that case a chromosomal abnormality results in an extra \xE2\x80\x9CX\xE2\x80\x9D chromosome. Another symptom could be hypogonadism, which results in impaired testicular function, and leads to a low or non-existent sex drive, or abnormal sexual functioning. In general anything that has affected the liver causing high estrogen, resulting in extremely low testosterone could put a man at risk for breast cancer.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Patch: </strong>When should men be screened for breast cancer or receive a mammogram?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Dr. Harris: </strong>Screening is recommended for men that carry the BReast CAncer gene 2 (BRCA2) or those who have already been found to be in the high risk category. Men should be screened for the BRCA2 gene if their mother, sister or relative was diagnosed with the gene or breast cancer. We recommend genetic testing for the BRCA2 gene if the mother was found to carry it, because it is likely for that person to develop breast cancer. So if a mother finds that she carries this gene than her son should at the very least should be tested for the gene, and if not tested then take a screened mammogram.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong> The question is why is he getting a screening mammogram? He should know something like he is high risk. The men we see in our center definitely have problems when the request a mammogram. So they receive a diagnostic mammogram, which is a more extensive mammogram compared to a screening mammogram.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Patch:</strong> Does family gene tendency matter if you're a man?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong> Yes. You should research your family tree as much possible to see if there is a genetic link. We find that men diagnosed with breast cancer carry the BRAC1 or BRAC2 gene. Usually if a mom has this gene every sibling has a 50/50 chance of inheriting it from their mother. A patient might see women in his family, sisters, moms, cousins, aunts, that have breast cancer or ovarian cancer.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p><strong>Dr. Harris: </strong>Mastectomy is almost always the course of action because there is so little tissue. Some men also receive medical therapy such as chemotherapy or hormonal therapy in the form of anti-estrogen medication.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Patch: </strong>What type of examinations can males do at home and do doctors teach them this on visits like women?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong> They can self exam, but if a man is not at high risk I don't think they are taught to do the self exam compared to women who are taught this in routine doctor visits. But in the face of no high risk issues the men are not learning. Usually men discover they have breast cancer because they feel a lump when they are putting on their clothes, or maybe they experience discomfort in the area.</p>\n\

    							<p>GREEN, Ohio -- ATM maker Diebold Inc. says it has changed its mind about building a $100 million global headquarters in northern Ohio. </p>
    <p>However, the $2.8 billion technology company said it is committed to keeping its existing Ohio operations in Green, near Akron. </p>
    <p>The company said Thursday it was suspending "indefinitely" its plans to build new corporate headquarters in Ohio in order to focus on growing its business. </p>
    <p>Diebold's overseas operations have been battered in recent months. </p>
    <p>As part of its cost-cutting efforts, Diebold will eliminate about 500 jobs in North America and Brazil over the next 30 days, including fewer than 75 positions in northeast Ohio. </p>
    <p>The company has about 2,000 employees in the state. </p>
    <p>The company broke the news to Ohio officials and local employees this week. </p>

    			  <p><em>By Diane Smith | Staff Writer</em></p><p>Excited children painted and rolled pumpkins and jumped rope to celebrate the Ravenna Downtown Farmers Market&rsquo;s last day Thursday.</p><p>Area children enjoyed temperatures in the upper 70s as they excitedly painted and rolled the produce, while their parents took the opportunity to do some shopping themselves. Several vendors also brought their children along to enjoy the fun.</p><p>The market, which opened this spring, had its last day on Thursday, a week earlier than the original Nov. 1 closing date.</p><p>Organizers marked the day with an &ldquo;Oktoberfest&rdquo; featuring live music and activities for children.</p><p>&ldquo;The kids are having a blast,&rdquo; said market manager Kelly Ferry, adding that the weather was &ldquo;spectacular&rdquo; and brought a big crowd during the early hours. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t have asked for better weather for our last day.&rdquo;</p>  <p> <p>The jump rope contest, sponsored by the Ravenna Fit Chicks, was originally open only to children between the ages of 8 and 10, but was opened to other children who expressed an interest. Leslie Keegan of the Fit Chicks said the goal was to encourage children to exercise.</p><p>Each child got to keep a jump rope, and winners in each age category were presented with Frisbees, water bottle, T-shirts and pedometers.</p><p>Jenna Kendrick of Ravenna brought her three children to the market. Arystah, 8, was the winner of the jump rope contest in her age category with 49 jumps. Alaynah, 6 and Ayden, 4, took part in the contests, with Ayden scoring well in the pumpkin roll.</p><p>Kendrick said her oldest daughter had been in gymnastics and instantly took to the jump rope contest.<br>&ldquo;She does it so fast,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>She said the family often comes to the market, and will miss it when it closes for the season.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a great thing for the community,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Mayor Joseph Bica came to watch the festivities.</p><p>&ldquo;I think we had an exceptional season, and we are looking forward to next year,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be bigger and better, and maybe relocated.&rdquo;</p><p>The city is considering redeveloping an old concrete plant for use as a city park, and is applying for grant money to make the park a reality.</p><p>Brennady Barnes, a 13-year-old violinist from Stow, played alongside Jon Mosely during the last 30 minutes of Mosely&rsquo;s performance. After Mosely left, Brennady stayed on to perform several songs for the crowd.</p><p>Her parents, Don and Shonnet Barnes, said their daughter started playing the violin about three years ago, and this is the first time she&rsquo;s branched out into solo performances, mostly at farmers markets. In addition to the Ravenna market, she also has performed at the Haymaker Farmers Market, which Ferry also manages, and the market in Stow.</p><p>She said she enjoyed the chance to play beside Mosely.</p><p>&ldquo;It was really fun, and it just enhances it so much when you have another instrument playing along with you,&rdquo; she said.</p><p><em>Contact this reporter at 330-298-1139 or <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.recordpub.com%2fnews%2farticle%2fmailto%3adsmith%40recordpub.com">dsmith@recordpub.com</a></em></p></p>

    <p>There are good acronyms, and there are not so good acronyms. With <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexingtonma.gov%2fSelectmen%2fcommittee%2fGreenway.cfm\">ACROSS Lexington</a>, the town's <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexingtonma.gov%2fSelectmen%2fcommittee%2fGreenway.cfm\">Greenways Corridor Committee</a> believes it has a an acronym that's working out quite nicely.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>ACROSS stands for Accessing Conservation land, Recreation areas, Open  space, Schools and Streets and it's the major initiative of the Greenways Corridor Committee. The goal is to create 40 miles of well marked walking/running/biking routes linking trails, schools and conservation land around town. And it starts with a pilot route of 5.5 miles, which opens this weekend.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><blockquote>&#13;\n\
    <p>(Watch the video to your right to hear more about ACROSS Lexington and the pilot.)</p>&#13;\n\
    </blockquote><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The pilot route, like those to come, connects with the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexington.patch.com%2flistings%2fminuteman-bikeway\">Minuteman Bikeway</a>, which will act as sort of a \"spine\" for the eventual network of ACROSS Lexington trails. Individually and as a whole, the trail network will promote alternative passive recreation and transportation options.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Lexington\xC2\xA0 has all of treasure trove of resources, and this is a way to connect them all,\" said Keith Ohmart, chairman of the Greenways Corridor Committee. \"It's a different way of thinking of and linking those resources.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The routes throughout the network are largely existing roads and trails, which will be marked with ACROSS Lexington sinage and posts. A map will depict each route.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Greenways Corridor Committee is hoping to complete additional routes over the next three years and eventually link the 40  miles, according to Rick Abrams, co-chairman of the committee. To guide the work, they're using a map provided by the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexingtonma.gov%2fcommittees%2fconservationcom.cfm\">Conservation Commission</a> that includes overlaid conservation lands. Schools will also be along the routes, providing another safe option for students to and from school.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>After the pilot route comes onboard this weekend, Abrans said the committee will be looking for feedback from the public about sinage and whatever else comes to mind. The best way to submit that feedback, he said, is through a link on <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexingtonma.gov%2fSelectmen%2fcommittee%2fGreenway.cfm\">the committee's website, which you can access here</a>.</p>\n\

    <p>Tired of giving out the same fun-sized bags of candy on Halloween? Looking for a perhaps healthier or non-food idea to hand out on the upcoming holiday? Patch Picks is providing some ideas, with just a few days left before the Oct. 31 holiday.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>I'll start with a disclaimer that I'm not to be blamed if your house gets egged or toilet papered by little ghouls or goblins whose sweet tooth you angered by handing out pencils or raisins.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>That said, you might be looking for some Halloween candy alternatives. Here's some inspiration:</p><p>&#13;
    </p><ul><li><strong>Dried fruits: </strong>Raisins were never popular when I was growing up, but they are good on oatmeal or in cookies. Dried cranberries, bananas, apricots or trail mixes are also good ideas. They're less real, but fruit snacks can be popular with kids.</li>&#13;
    <li><strong>Nuts:</strong> You don't get them on many planes anymore, but the fun-sized bags of nuts still do exist. Trick or Treaters might just go nuts for your selection. (Sorry, couldn't resist...)</li>&#13;
    <li><strong>Snacks:</strong> Goldfish crackers, peanut butter crackers, or other totable items might make parents thank you when it comes to packing school lunches.</li>&#13;
    <li><strong>School supplies:</strong> Who couldn't use another pencil, pen or eraser? Bonus points for Halloween-themed items. </li>&#13;
    <li><strong>Homemade treats:</strong> A lot of these end up in the trash can thanks to razor-blade fearing parents. But if you live in a tight-knit neighborhood where everyone knows your name, take a crack at a homemade treat like popcorn balls, Rice Krispy treats or another concoction from your cauldron.</li>&#13;
    </ul><p>Most of these items can be found at <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2flistings%2fcrosbys-marketplace">Crosby's</a>, <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2flistings%2fconcord-convenience">Concord Convenience</a> or other local stores. Plus, your kids can stock up on eggs and toilet paper while you're forgoing the candy aisle (we're kidding, of course).</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Do you have other non-candy Halloween hand-out ideas? Leave yours in the comments.</p>

    <p>View the new exhibit at the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.concordart.org%2f\">Concord Art Association</a>, 37 Lexington Rd., for its new exhibit that runs through November 18.  <strong>It is about art and food.</strong> This exhibit brings together artists who work in a variety of media and materials \xC2\x96 including edible ones \xC2\x96 to express a range of intentions. Some artists use food imagery as a metaphor for human relations and society\xC2\x92s challenges, others to celebrate memory, while others delve into the complexities of the structure of food itself \xC2\x96 exploring line, color, pattern, and space. In conjunction with this exhibit, Concord Art Association will be collecting donations of canned goods for <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.opentable.org%2f\">Open Table</a> through November 18.</p>\n\n\
    <p>And at the <strong>Emerson Umbrella</strong>, be sure to catch an exhibit featuring Kayo Burmon, resident artist at the Umbrella, with a collection of very diverse works created over the last few years. Kayo explains, \"Sleepless nights are common among artists. It is no wonder. Days are replete with action, colors, patterns, images, shapes, sounds, emotions, light and dark, people, stories, news, illness, birth, death, experiences\xC2\x96both painful and pleasant\xC2\x96nature\xC2\x92s best and worst\xC2\x85. To distill all this in a way that can be translated into a work of art is an enigma. The result? Sleepless nights.\"  Free.</p>\n\n\
    <p><strong>The Concord Museum</strong> has a new exhibit, \xC2\x93<em>The Greatest Source of Wealth: Agriculture in Concord</em>,\xC2\x94 in the Wallace Kane Gallery through March 17, 2013. </p>\n\n\
    <p>The <strong>library </strong>has an agricultural exhibit in conjunction with the Museum. Visit 129 Main Street to take it in. The display is part of a collaborative focus on farming between the library, the Concord Museum, and ConcordCAN. The program offerings include two exhibitions (the library's and also one at the Concord Museum), a film series, a lecture series, and a book discussion of \"The Dirty Life\" by Kristin Kimball (a featured \"Concord Reads\" book). </p>\n\n\
    <p>The town runs on volunteer energy and commitment. The following <strong>boards and committees have openings</strong>.

    <p>Lexington\xC2\x92s Department of Public works is asking residents to assist with clearing leaves from storm drains in front of their property in preparation for possible heavy rains early next week.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Crews from the department are already clearing storm drains and brook culverts in anticipation of high winds and rain that could be caused by Hurricane Sandy early next week.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The hurricane is forecast to hit around the Delaware/New Jersey border early Tuesday and the large storm is expected to impact New England.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Lexington officials issued a press release Friday afternoon requesting that residents assist in the storm drain cleanups because of the amount of foliage that has been dropping quickly and is making it impossible to clear all  5,000 drains and catch basins in the town by Sunday evening.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The town is asking that residents check the storm drains, rake away any leaves or pine needles and dispose of the leaves and debris in yard waste bins or paper leaf bags. For more tips about preparing for the storm, the town is encouraging residents to visit the website of the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.mass.gov%2feopss%2fagencies%2fmema%2fmema-offers-tips-as-hurricane-sandy-approaches.html\">Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency</a> .</p></div>\n\n\

    </p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>This Saturday, Oct. 27 <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fsaveourheritage.com%2f\">Save Our Heritage</a> and <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2flistings%2fminute-man-national-historical-park\">Minute Man National Historical Park</a> are holding an event to celebrate the completion of the Save Our Heritage restoration of Barrett Farm, and the transfer of its ownership to the National Park Service, Minute Man National Historical Park.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A public ceremony with U.S. Rep Niki Tsongas and others will take place at Barrett Farm, 448 Barretts Mill Road, Concord at 11 a.m., followed by an Open House from noon to 4 p.m.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Restoration of the historic Barrett House, built in 1705, began eight years ago when Save Our Heritage (SOH), a Concord-based nonprofit preservation organization, acquired Barrett Farm and the 3.4 acres of surrounding land from the McGrath family.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CIt was a collaborative effort right from the start between Save Our Heritage, the Town, the Park, and the McGraths,\xE2\x80\x9D said Neil Rasmussen, president of SOH.\xC2\xA0 \xE2\x80\x9COur shared goal was to have Save Our Heritage restore the Col. James Barrett House to the way it was during Revolutionary times, and to eventually incorporate it into Minute Man Park so that visitors could experience it as living history. And that time has finally come.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Col. James Barrett Farm is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as one of the most important Revolutionary War landmarks of national significance. Col. James Barrett, a member of the Provincial Congress, was the senior officer and overall field commander at the North Bridge in the first battle of the American Revolution. He was also in charge of all the supplies in the area, enough for an army of 15,000. When the British Regulars marched to Concord on April 19, 1775, they were intent on seizing weapons and other military supplies stored throughout the town, including a major stockpile on Colonel Barrett\xE2\x80\x99s property.\xC2\xA0The farm and the Barrett family provide a central link to the story of \xE2\x80\x9Cthe shot heard \xE2\x80\x98round the world.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Barrett property has been farmed continuously from Colonial times to the present, and has been owned by only two families over the past 300 years -- the Barretts for 200 of those years, and the McGraths for 100. Michael McGrath now resides in a house behind the Col. James Barrett house, and his late brother Patrick farmed the surrounding land and ran the McGrath Farmstand across the road.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Since 2004, the exterior restoration of Barrett House has seen the stabilization of the back wall; completion of a new wood roof; application of hand-skived pine clapboards; and the installation of handmade replications of the original 1770\xE2\x80\x99s doors and faithful reproductions of the original window frames and sash.\xC2\xA0In addition, archaeological studies were conducted, and the land behind the house was cleared to reveal a more open agrarian landscape. Painstaking restoration and preservation of the interior of the house has included stabilizing of original plaster walls; repointing of fireboxes; and the restoration of wood paneling and floors.\xC2\xA0In addition, careful paint conservation techniques have revealed many original and exceedingly rare colonial paint surfaces.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CMuch of our restoration work employed methods and materials used in the 18th century, wherever possible,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jim Cunningham, the project manager forSOH-Barrett Farm.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The wood used to stabilize the post and beam structure was hand-hewn by traditional timber framers, and wrought iron reproduction hardware was fashioned by Concord\xE2\x80\x99s local blacksmith, Carl Close. As a result of this meticulous attention to details, when visitors enter the house, they are transported to Revolutionary times and can sense a direct, living, tangible link to the beginning of our nation.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>This eight-year restoration project was generously funded by four CPA grants from the town of Concord, a Save America\xE2\x80\x99s Treasures grant from the Department of the Interior, and numerous private donations. Many town departments and committees have provided critical assistance and dozens of volunteers and organizations, including the Boy Scouts, have donated their time and effort to the project.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CRestoring Barrett Farm was only one part of the preservation effort. Getting it incorporated into Minute Man National Historical Park was the other part, and this involved a three-part process at the federal level spanning several years,\xE2\x80\x9D said Anna West Winter, executive director of SOH. \xE2\x80\x9CIn 2005, the late Senator Edward Kennedy and former Representative Marty Meehan lent their energetic support to sponsoring legislation to facilitate a feasibility study of the farm's inclusion in the Park.\xC2\xA0 Later,\xE2\x80\x9D Winter adds, \xE2\x80\x9Cin 2009, thanks to the steadfast leadership of Congresswoman Niki Tsongas, Minute Man Park\xE2\x80\x99s boundaries were expanded by Congressional legislation to include the Col. James Barrett House and additional surrounding acres.\xE2\x80\x9D\xC2\xA0Finally, this year Congress appropriated the funds needed for the National Park Service to acquire Barrett House and the surrounding land.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CWe\xE2\x80\x99re delighted to finally have the Col. James Barrett House incorporated into Minute Man National Historical Park,\xE2\x80\x9D stated the Park\xE2\x80\x99s Supertintendent, Nancy Nelson.\xC2\xA0 \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s something we have been looking forward to for a long time. Barrett Farm completes the narrative of the beginning of the American Revolution within the Park.\xE2\x80\x9D\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Barrett Farm Celebration on October 27 at 11:00 a.m. will be held outside on the lawn, rain or shine at 448 Barretts Mill Road.\xC2\xA0</p>\n\

    <p>The latest track of Hurricane Sandy has the storm pushing farther west according to this morning\xE2\x80\x99s meteorologists' reports. The National Hurricane Center has the center of the storm going either into southern New Jersey or Delaware.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>But this is a constantly changing storm, and a more northern track, which is possible, would signficicantly affect us here in New England.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>According to WHDH Meteorologist <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww1.whdh.com%2fweather%2fblog%2fpage%2f1%2f\">Chris Lambert,</a> the current likely scenario would bring wind and rain Monday afternoon through Tuesday with wind gusts of 40-60 mph, mostly onshore, strongest at the coast with up to 5 inches of rain expected throughout the storm\xE2\x80\x99s duration. Power outages are likely, along with beach erosion and coastal flooding during high tides.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Lambert says it\xE2\x80\x99s still a \xE2\x80\x9Cvery complicated and anomalous pattern\xE2\x80\x9D and thus the timing is tricky.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>If Sandy maintains a warm core longer into the forecast period, it may hold on longer than some of the models project. If that happens, the turn northwest into the coast would happen farther north and put southern New England in a more serious situation than the current path would take it. \xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nhc.noaa.gov%2ftext%2frefresh%2fMIATCPAT3%2bshtml%2f260848.shtml\">National Hurricane Center </a>has the hurricane currently with sustained winds of 80 mph, moving north at 13 mph. The storm is expected to decrease in speed today, followed by a turn toward the north tonight, and a turn toward the northeast on Saturday. The center of the storm will continue moving near the northwestern Bahamas this morning and move north of the Bahamas tonight.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Hurricane force winds extend outward up to 35 miles from the center, with tropical storm force winds extending up to 275 miles. Sandy\xE2\x80\x99s wind field is expected to grow in size during the next couple of days.</p>\n\

    When <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fNathaniel%2520Folsom">Nathaniel Folsom</a>, newly appointed general of the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fNew%2520Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> troops, arrived at the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fsiege%2520of%2520Boston">siege of Boston</a> in late June 1775, he found this chain of command:<br>
    <blockquote>

    Those others included <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fWilliam%2520Heath">William Heath</a>, <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fJoseph_Frye">Joseph Frye</a>, and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.geni.com%2fpeople%2fBrig-Gen-John-Whitcomb%2f6000000008174405808">John Whitcomb</a> of Massachusetts; <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.connecticutsar.org%2fpatriots%2fspencer.htm">Joseph Spencer</a> and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fIsrael%2520Putnam">Israel Putnam</a> of <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fConnecticut">Connecticut</a>; and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fNathanael%2520Greene">Nathanael Greene</a> of <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fRhode%2520Island">Rhode Island</a>, as well as Folsom himself. </p><p>I wrote about Folsom&#8217;s difficulty asserting his authority over Col. <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fJohn%2520Stark">John Stark</a> <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2f2011%2f06%2fgeneral-folsom-and-colonel-stark.html">back here</a>. One week after the New Hampshire officers had worked out their differences, Gen. <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fGeorge%2520Washington">George Washington</a> arrived in <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fCambridge">Cambridge</a> and upset the whole arrangement. </p><p>There doesn&#8217;t seem to have been any resistance to the Virginian becoming the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fContinental%2520Congress">Continental Congress</a>&#8217;s new commander-in-chief. Rather, he also brought along the Congress&#8217;s commissions for subordinate generals, and they didn&#8217;t match the situation on the ground. Ward had already written to <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fJohn%2520Hancock">John Hancock</a> that the new appointments might &#8220;create Uneasiness among us; which we ought, at this critical Time, to be extremely careful to avoid.&#8221; </p><p>The Congress has decided to rank the generals under Washington this way:<br>
    <ul>
    
    <li>as brigadier generals, <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fSeth_Pomeroy">Seth Pomeroy</a> of Massachusetts, <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fRichard%2520Montgomery">Richard Montgomery</a> of New York, <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fweb.cortland.edu%2fwoosterk%2fGen_David02.html">David Wooster</a> of Connecticut, Heath, Spencer, Thomas, <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fJohn%2520Sullivan">John Sullivan</a> of New Hampshire, Greene, and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fHoratio%2520Gates">Horatio Gates</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    Schuyler, Montgomery, and Wooster were assigned to the defense of northern New York/invasion of southern <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fCanada">Canada</a>.</p><p>The New England delegates in the Congress had tried to replicate the seniority of their colonies&#8217; militia officers, and were also swayed by reports of the Battle of <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fLexington">Lexington</a> and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fConcord">Concord</a> (which Heath had participated in) and the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2f2010%2f08%2fwhat-should-we-call-fighting-in-late.html">skirmish over Noddle&#8217;s Island</a> (which Putnam had led). The Congress therefore elevated Putnam over Spencer even though Connecticut had ranked Putnam third among its generals. The Congress also made Heath outrank Thomas even though Heath was taking orders from Thomas. </p><p>In addition, the Congress <i>hadn&#8217;t</i> learned several things. Pomeroy had never accepted his general&#8217;s rank in the Massachusetts army (though he had fought in the Battle of <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fBunker%2520Hill">Bunker Hill</a>). Frye, Whitcomb, and Folsom were all exercising commands in the army outside Boston. And on 23 June the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fMassachusetts%2520Provincial%2520Congress">Massachusetts Provincial Congress</a> had voted to make Col. <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fRichard%2520Gridley">Richard Gridley</a> of the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fartillery">artillery</a> regiment into another major general. </p><p>By the time Washington realized what a mess this was, he had already given Putnam his commission as Continental major general and couldn&#8217;t take it back. On 10 July he wrote to Philadelphia: <br>
    <blockquote>
    The great Dissatisfaction expressed on this Subject &amp; the apparent Danger of throwing the whole Army into the utmost Disorder, together with the strong Representations made by the Provincial Congress, have induced me to retain the Commissions in my Hands untill the pleasure of the Congress should be farther known&#8230; </blockquote>
    In fact, on 5 July, only three days after the new commander reached Cambridge, Spencer had convinced a large number of Connecticut officers to sign a letter to their legislature protesting the Congress&#8217;s decision and then set off for Hartford to deliver it himself. Or, as Washington wrote, &#8220;General Spencer was so much disgusted at the Preference given to General Puttnam, that he left the Army without visiting me, or making known his Intentions in any Respect.&#8221;</p><p>And Gen. Thomas was talking about leaving, too. </p><p>TOMORROW: Gen. Washington handles his first managerial crisis.</p>

    \t\t\t\t\t<p>State and federal officials continue to investigate an outbreak of hepatitis C at Exeter Hospital in New Hampshire. The outbreak, in a cardiac cathertization lab, may be the result of an infected worker replacing sterile syringes with used ones while stealing drugs, investigators have said. Globe correspondent Helen Shun <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2fnews%2flocal%2fmassachusetts%2farticles%2f2012%2f06%2f16%2fnh_public_health_officials_suspect_hospital_worker_in_hepatitis_outbreak%2f%3fpage%3dfull\">wrote about the case earlier this month</a>. </p>\n\
    <p>At least 20 people, including one employee, have tested positive for the virus, though more have joined a class action lawsuit. One, a 49-year-old man who has not publicly given his name, has talked about the experience. </p>\n\n\

    <p>She goes on: \xE2\x80\x9CThe secrecy surrounding HCV has big consequences. Public health officials have long struggled to determine how many Americans have HCV, but most estimates put the figure somewhere between 3 million and 4 million.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\
    <p>Heckman, a longtime friend and mentor, knows what she\xE2\x80\x99s talking about. She contracted hepatitis C through a blood transfusion when she was an infant. <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.concordmonitor.com%2fhcv\">In 2010, she wrote a moving series</a> about the role the disease plays in her life, her struggle with the stigma of hepatitis, and her experience in a clinical trial testing drugs expected to cure it.</p>\n\
    <p>Heckman calls the surging numbers of people in the United States expected to be diagnosed with hepatitis C in the coming years -- and the cost to care for them -- \xE2\x80\x9Cdizzying.\xE2\x80\x9D But, she says, \xE2\x80\x9CI believe that small acts - like debunking rumors, smashing stereotypes and disclosing your infection - can make a big difference.\xE2\x80\x9D </p>\r\n\

    <p>Gov. Deval Patrick has declared a state of emergency and held a press conference Saturday afternoon to update the public about how the state is preparing for the impact of Hurricane Sandy.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Sandy is currently a category 1 hurricane rolling up the Atlantic and is expected to turn northwest Sunday afternoon. Impact on New England from the storm is expected by Sunday night and could linger until Wednesday.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"While we continue to hope for the best, we are planning for the worst," Patrick said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>There may be coastal flooding, severe beach erosion, damaging winds, widespread power outages, and possibly 5 inches or more of rain.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"This afternoon I declared a state of emergency Commonwealth-wide," Patrick said. "This enables us to cut through some of the red tape sometimes involved in securing the necessary services, supplies and personnel I want to be sure we have in advance of Hurricane Sandy reaching us."</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Patrick added that there were 200 National Guard members on duty Saturday and would be 1,000 on duty by Monday to supply armories, fill sandbags, assist victims and transport emergency personnel.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>The administration is also in constant contact with utility companies, as widespread power outages are expected.</p><p>&#13;

    <p><a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nhc.noaa.gov%2f%23SANDY">Sandy has been upgraded again to a hurricane</a> just hours after being downgraded to a tropical storm, according to The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA),</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>In its 8 a.m. bulletin, the NOAA reported an Air Force aircraft found hurricane-strength winds again of 75 mph, just enough to push Sandy over the 74 mph threshold between tropical storm and hurricane.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>The latest track shows that Sandy will make landfall in southern New Jersey, but New England will certainly feel its effects.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"Storm track not likely to matter at this point," according to a <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=https%3a%2f%2ftwitter.com%2fcbsboston%2fstatus%2f262175202690088960">Tweet from CBS Boston</a>. "Sandy takes aim at New England."</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Jeremy Reiner writes on the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww1.whdh.com%2fweather%2fblog%2fpage%2f1%2f%23ixzz2AVNea0nr">WHDH weather blog</a> that he expects this area to feel the earliest effects of Sandy on Monday morning with some rain and wind. The worst of Sandy's impact, however, Reiner expects to occur "in the window of 11 a.m. Monday to 2 a.m. Tuesday.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Reiner writes:</p><p>&#13;
    </p><blockquote>&#13;
    <p>"Within this period is our greatest risk of wind damage/power loss. Many  towns will experience wind gusts over 40mph during this time and  coastal cities and towns may see wind gusts between 50-60mph. the  concern isn't so much the speed itself but the duration as several hours  of 40mph wind gusts may be able to bring down trees &amp; power lines."</p>&#13;
    </blockquote><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Reiner goes on to say that he believes "rainfall looks manageable," with most towns expected to receive from 1-3 inches.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>In its 5 a.m. bulletin, the NOAA issued warnings and watches to the Southeastern parts of the country, including Florida, but said those up the Eastern seaboard need to prepare for its impact. The storm is moving North-Northeast at 10 mph and an increase in intensity and speed possible tonight and Sunday, <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nhc.noaa.gov%2ftext%2frefresh%2fMIATCPAT3%2bshtml%2f270846.shtml">according to the NOAA</a>.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Sandy is currently considered to be "very large," with winds extending as far as 450 miles from its center.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>The storm killed more than 40 people as it moved through the Caribbean.</p>

    <div><div>
    				<p>    I have been reading essays by Ralph Waldo Emerson, specifically his treatise on History, which he denies the existence of, but he does mention that Biographies are real.  He compares man to mosquitoes, leaves, and other forms of life.  He argues that all history is subjective because it is formulated to propogate an explanation for a political leader&#8217;s decisions.  Biographies, he argues are  more relevant because they are objective.  He makes a good point. </p>
    <p>     What does that have to do with my mind?  Probably not much but it is interesting fodder for a good philosophical discussion.  &#8220;Nature is a mutable cloud, which is always and never the same.&#8221;  I like to read older writing because the writer is now perhaps wiser than we are in our world of Internet Technology.  Instant gratification is  like printing on your computer or putting your ideas on a blog.  I am guilty of doing both. </p>
    <p>     One thing that does make older authors interesting is their lack of knowledge of the two second sound bite.  They write from their knowledge and from their hearts.  They do not form their opinion based on a small amount of information, they come to their conclusion in an argumentative way, they use their writing to change opinions or clarify theirs.  We are voting for one of the most important Presidents of the United States based on two second sound bites, not volumes of position papers.  Is there any wonder that we are frightened of our choices?  We have not written, like Emerson did, great treatises on our thoughts.  We need to.  It might be boring, we might have few ideas, but our ideas are as important as Emerson&#8217;s.  What we need to do is write them down and not send them through Facebook or Twitter. </p>
    <p>     What we have to do is try to get our ideas published.  In Thoreau&#8217;s time it was not uncommon to spend your own money to be published.  His book on traveling the Concord and Merrimack Rivers was self-published,  My father, Wayne Peters, wrote a very good, engrossing book about the Middlesex Canal.  He paid for their publication and I still get orders for them even now.  We all have a book in us, publish it.</p>
    <p>     As always, I have a few comments on the election.  First, the presidential race.  I noticed on the news that the President was appealing very favorably to the younger voter.  I also noticed that Mitt Romney was  appealing to the white male voter.  When my brother-in-law, Paul Tsongas, announced that he was going to run against Edward Brooke, the black Senator from Massachusetts, he was asked how he could justify it in his own mind.  &#8220;I believe we have crossed that barrier&#8221; he countered.  We had not totally.    John Sununu tonight implied that Colin Powell endorsed Barach Obama because of their mutual skin color, not the virtues of their intellects.  I personally believe that race is in that picture.</p>
    <p>     On the Senatorial side, Scott Brown has finally come up with some good commercials saying what he stands for, and why.  For too long, he has been in a mad, as in barely fathomable, attack mode.  Now his latest commercials are decent and about his goals.  Elizabeth Warren is trying to make a niche in the fact that a vote for Scott Brown could turn the Senate into a Republican body.  That is a good tactic, a fair one. </p>
    <p>     On the Congressional side, Jon Golnik had quite a few supporters, who did not follow the moderator&#8217;s rules, by the way, at a debate I had the pleasure of attending.  Niki Tsongas had the best line, however, when she said that Golnik, if sent to Congress, would be &#8220;irrelevant&#8221; because of a pledge he signed which would keep him from being able to vote on financing the government.  That is just what we need and want, a Congressman without a wish to fund the government.  With all of the millions of dollars that Niki has brought into the district through negotiation, she deserves to be returned.</p>
    <p>     So, what are my predictions?  Well, I have made them to a few people.  We shall see if I will be right.</p>

    <p>Gov. Deval Patrick has declared a state of emergency and held a press conference Saturday afternoon to update the public about how the state is preparing for the impact of Hurricane Sandy.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Sandy is currently a category 1 hurricane rolling up the Atlantic and is expected to turn northwest Sunday afternoon. Impact on New England from the storm is expected by Sunday night and could linger until Wednesday.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"While we continue to hope for the best, we are planning for the worst," Patrick said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>There may be coastal flooding, severe beach erosion, damaging winds, widespread power outages, and possibly 5 inches or more of rain.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"This afternoon I declared a state of emergency Commonwealth-wide," Patrick said. "This enables us to cut through some of the red tape sometimes involved in securing the necessary services, supplies and personnel I want to be sure we have in advance of Hurricane Sandy reaching us."</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Patrick added that there were 200 National Guard members on duty Saturday and would be 1,000 on duty by Monday to supply armories, fill sandbags, assist victims and transport emergency personnel.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>The administration is also in constant contact with utility companies, as widespread power outages are expected.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Patrick advised residents to complete any errands they may have by Sunday evening. Residents may be asked to stay off the roads during the storm. For T-service updates, customers are urged to visit <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fmbta.com">mbta.com.</a></p><p>&#13;

    </p><p>The DPW has had multiple crews out clearing storm drains on a daily  basis.\xC2\xA0 However, Lexington has over 5,000 storm drains/catchbasins and  the trees have been dropping the fall foliage quickly which makes it  impossible to clear all drains by Sunday evening. As such, town leaders are asking residents to check storm drains, rake leaves  and pine needles away from the drain (not into the drain) and dispose of  the leaves and debris in yard waste bins or brown paper leaf bags. However, <strong>do not remove the storm grates</strong>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>As well, the town is asking residents not to rake or blow leaves from your property into the street,  as street sweepers cannot pick up large piles of leaves.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>Jeremy Reiner writes on the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww1.whdh.com%2fweather%2fblog%2fpage%2f1%2f%23ixzz2AVNea0nr">WHDH weather blog</a> that he expects this area to feel the earliest effects of Sandy on Monday morning with some rain and wind. The worst of Sandy's impact, however, Reiner expects to occur "in the window of 11 a.m. Monday to 2 a.m. Tuesday.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Reiner writes:</p><p>&#13;
    </p><blockquote>&#13;
    <p>"Within this period is our greatest risk of wind damage/power loss. Many  towns will experience wind gusts over 40mph during this time and  coastal cities and towns may see wind gusts between 50-60mph. the  concern isn't so much the speed itself but the duration as several hours  of 40mph wind gusts may be able to bring down trees &amp; power lines."</p>&#13;
    </blockquote><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Reiner goes on to say that he believes "rainfall looks manageable," with most towns expected to receive from 1-3 inches.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>In its 5 a.m. bulletin, the NOAA issued warnings and watches to the Southeastern parts of the country, including Florida, but said those up the Eastern seaboard need to prepare for its impact. The storm is moving North-Northeast at 10 mph and an increase in intensity and speed possible tonight and Sunday, <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nhc.noaa.gov%2ftext%2frefresh%2fMIATCPAT3%2bshtml%2f270846.shtml">according to the NOAA</a>.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Sandy is currently considered to be "very large," with winds extending as far as 450 miles from its center.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>The storm killed more than 40 people as it moved through the Caribbean.</p>

    <p><em>The following information was provided on behalf of the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.llwv.org\">League of Women Voters of Lexington</a>. </em></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Since the election of 2010, a number of states have passed  laws that have imposed new voter ID requirements and restricted access  to the polls. These laws reverse a trend, begun with the Voting Rights  Act of 1965, to make voting more accessible to all Americans.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Opponents  of these laws worry that they will have a disproportionate effect on the  ability of racial minority voters, as well as the less affluent and  students, to vote in 2012. Many worry (or hope) that these laws will  have an influence on who wins the presidency in November.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>This  talk, to be held at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 30 at the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexington.patch.com%2flistings%2flexington-depot\">Lexington Depot</a>, discusses the rise of these laws, which are intended to tighten-up  access to the polls, and the larger political context that has led to  their passage. Despite the clearly partisan politics of these laws,  Professor Stewart will discuss why they are unlikely to have much of an  influence on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election. This is not  to say that problems with election administration more generally  couldn't lead to a repeat of the 2000 fiasco. Many of the \"battleground  states\" have features of their voting systems that could lead to  controversy, conflict, and chaos, should the results of the election  rest on an election dispute in one of these states.\xC2\xA0</p><p><strong>About the Speaker:\xC2\xA0</strong>Charles  Stewart III is the Kenan Sahin Distinguished Professor of Political  Science at MIT, where he has taught since 1985. His research and  teaching areas include congressional politics, elections, and American  political development. His current research about Congress touches on  the historical development of committees, party leadership, and Senate  elections. Since 2001, Professor Stewart has been a member of the  Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project, a leading research effort that  applies scientific analysis to questions about election technology,  election administration, and election reform. He is currently the MIT  director of the project. Professor Stewart is an established leader in  the analysis of the performance of election systems and the quantitative  assessment of election performance.</p>\n\

    </div><p>It is a chilly, damp morning across the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.examiner.com%2ftopic%2fakron\" class=\"inline_link\">Akron</a> area, but <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.examiner.com%2ftopic%2fweather\" class=\"inline_link\">weather</a> conditions are going to get much worse over the next couple of days.</p>\n\
    <p><a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nhc.noaa.gov%2f\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hurricane Sandy</a> is currently moving northeastward off the coast of the southeastern United States.  (View the morning <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dtoA8YG48-Kc\" rel=\"nofollow\">IR</a> and <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3d6I_5Ccdn0rs\" rel=\"nofollow\">WV</a> satellite loops).  Deep moisture from the Atlantic is being pushed westward across the Mid Atlantic states and into <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.examiner.com%2ftopic%2fohio\" class=\"inline_link\">Ohio</a>.  This moisture, interacting with an old frontal boundary, has caused <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.examiner.com%2ftopic%2frain\" class=\"inline_link\">rain</a> to break out across the Akron area.  The rain will continue through the afternoon, and it could be heavy at times.  High temperatures this afternoon will reach the upper 40s.</p>\n\
    <p>Sandy will continue to linger off the cost tonight, with moisture continuing to stream westward across our area.  Rain will persist, and it could be heavy at times.  Overnight lows will fall to around 40 degrees.</p>\n\
    <p>On Monday, a large upper level trough will dig across the eastern U.S., capturing <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.examiner.com%2ftopic%2fhurricane\" class=\"inline_link\">Hurricane</a> Sandy and turning her northwestward toward the Mid Atlantic coast.  Rain and <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.examiner.com%2ftopic%2fwind\" class=\"inline_link\">wind</a> will increase across the area, especially Monday afternoon as the system approaches the coast.  High temperatures on Monday will be in the mid 40s.</p>\n\
    <p>The strongest winds and heaviest rains are expected across the Akron area Monday night and Tuesday as Sandy moves onshore across New Jersey, then west into Pennsylvania.  During this time frame, winds could gust 50 to 60 mph with occasional stronger gusts possible.  Trees and power lines will likely be toppled causing scattered power outages.  The NWS has issued a <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.erh.noaa.gov%2fer%2fcle%2f\" rel=\"nofollow\">High Wind Watch</a> for the Akron area through Tuesday. </p>\n\
    <p>In addition to the wind, heavy rains of 3 to 6 inches with locally higher amounts will be possible, in addition to what falls this weekend.  The NWS has also posted a <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.erh.noaa.gov%2fer%2fcle%2f\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flood Watch</a> for the Akron area through Tuesday.</p>\n\
    <p>Winds will gradually diminish on Wednesday, but the rains will persist.</p>\n\
    <p>This is going to be a long duration, high impact event.  Stay tuned for updates throughout the day on my <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.facebook.com%2fffnortheastohio\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook page</a> .</p>\n\

    </p><p><strong>He's pregnant?</strong> \xE2\x80\x94 A man entered <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fstrongsville.patch.com%2flistings%2fann-taylor-176\">Ann Taylor</a>\xC2\xA0at\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fstrongsville.patch.com%2flistings%2fsouthpark-center\">SouthPark Mall</a> on Oct. 16 to tell workers that he was pregnant \xE2\x80\x94 with triplets.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>An employee quickly called security on the man. A report said he was wearing earrings and carrying a pink backpack and black purse.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Mall security asked the man to leave, then <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fstrongsville.patch.com%2farticles%2fman-in-pink-says-he-s-pregnant-police-blotter\">escorted him out</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\

The Canton man was arrested by Cuyahoga Falls Police and charged with public indecency, a fourth-degree misdemeanor.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>A man went to the restaurant around 1 p.m. on Oct. 21, but decided to treat a hostess rudely during lunch.</p><p>&#13;\n\

Before exiting, he knocked a table over, breaking dishes and nearly hitting another customer, according to the police report.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Police arrested the 30-year-old Tallmadge resident and  charged him with criminal damaging, a second-degree misdemeanor, and  disorderly conduct, a fourth-degree misdemeanor. The man was released on a $350 personal recognizance bond.</p><p>&#13;\n\

Then he said if he could kiss me again, he would go, so I let him.\xE2\x80\x9D</p> <p class=\"p1\">That incident got\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\" data-scaytid=\"4\">Treder</span>\xC2\xA0removed from Scouting, but there was no report to police.\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\" data-scaytid=\"5\">Treder</span>\xC2\xA0later wrote to the Scout executive who handled his removal, thanking him for \xE2\x80\x9Ckeeping everything in confidence.\xE2\x80\x9D</p> <p class=\"p1\"> <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\" data-scaytid=\"8\">Treder</span>\xC2\xA0went on to oversee altar boys\xE2\x80\x99 training at a Catholic Church in the Milwaukee suburb of West Allis, where he was charged with assaulting a 10-year-old in 1989. Only then did police learn of the earlier incident with Scouts.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Scores of other cases noted in these so-called \xE2\x80\x9Cperversion files\xE2\x80\x9D show how leaders who were pushed out of Scouts for sexual offenses, but not reported to police, went on to strike again.</p> <p class=\"p1\">On paper, Scouting has one of the youth-service field\xE2\x80\x99s toughest systems for keeping child molesters out of its million-strong adult leadership corps and away from its 2.7 million youth members. Within a decade of its 1910 founding, the organization started its \"ineligible volunteer files\" on individuals it deemed unfit to participate in Scouting, usually for suspicions or evidence of sexual misconduct with children. Scout officials say the files -- containing assorted Scout correspondence, handwritten notes, legal documents, press clippings and letters from parents and Scouts -- blocked or removed many pedophiles from leadership posts.</p> <p class=\"p1\">But the Scripps investigative team's review of 1,881 such files from 1970 to 1991, ordered released by a California court and shared among an informal network of attorneys representing abuse victims, reveals the Boy Scouts in hundreds of cases failed to report suspicious behavior to law-enforcement authorities. In scores of cases, individuals suspected of child molestation were allowed to remain on probation or to resign quietly, leaving youths at risk in and outside of Scouting. In some cases, protecting the reputation of Scouting took precedence over protecting its young charges, records show. The files suggest at least 2,000 Scouts were victimized.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Scripps\xE2\x80\x99 review includes many of the same files publicly released Oct. 18, under court order, by an Oregon law firm that got them as evidence against the Boy Scouts.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Despite the Boy Scouts\xE2\x80\x99 tightened screening in recent years, the Scripps team also found evidence in court records that at least 13 Scout leaders abused Scouts within the last decade.</p> <p class=\"p1\">The files Scripps reviewed indicate:</p> <p class=\"p1\">-- Scouts or their parents brought claims of sexual abuse directly to senior Scouting officials 416 times. Officials referred just 117 -- or 28 percent -- to law-enforcement authorities.</p> <p class=\"p1\">-- Scout officials allowed at least 146 individuals suspected of sexual misconduct to resign quietly. Many files contained official Scout correspondence with this standard language: \xE2\x80\x9CPlease also understand that this decision and the reasons for it will be maintained as confidential.\xE2\x80\x9D</p> <p class=\"p1\">-- Thirty-eight Scout leaders accused of sexual molestation were placed on \xE2\x80\x9Cprobation,\xE2\x80\x9D meaning they could continue working with kids as long as there was no further misconduct or while getting therapy. (The Boy Scouts stopped offering probation in 1998.)</p> <p class=\"p1\">Scout officials \xE2\x80\x9Callowed these people to go on to molest other children,\xE2\x80\x9D said Seattle attorney Timothy\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Kosnoff\" data-scaytid=\"10\">Kosnoff</span>, who has represented more than 1,000 victims of child sex abuse and who shared the files with Scripps.</p> <p class=\"p1\">The Boy Scouts\xE2\x80\x99 national president, Wayne Perry, acknowledged the files show his organization \"did not maintain the standards that, certainly, we (have) today. And we fell short,\" he said in an interview with Scripps. \"... And for that -- for any of those victims and their families -- we are profoundly sorry.\"</p> <p class=\"p1\">Boy Scout officials have pledged to review all files from 1965 on to ensure that any suspicions of crime get referred</p></div> <div class='story'><p class=\"p1\">to law enforcement. \xE2\x80\x9CAny information the police want out of our files, they can have,\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 said Perry, a retired Washington state businessman who describes himself as the Boy Scouts\xE2\x80\x99 \xE2\x80\x9Cchief volunteer.\xE2\x80\x9D</p> <p class=\"p1\">Perry also told Scripps that the Boy Scouts' review would include whether Scout leaders had properly handled allegations of abuse: \"There were instances in the past where these people failed. And to the extent that they violated the law, they should be prosecuted. To the extent that they failed to follow our systems, they should be removed from our system.</p> <p class=\"p1\">\"Are we\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"gonna\" data-scaytid=\"11\">gonna</span>\xC2\xA0protect people who made mistakes -- willingly made mistakes? The answer is no.\"</p> <p class=\"p1\">Perry said the Boy Scouts continue keeping internal files -- a measure endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for all youth-serving groups. Providing a confidential outlet for sharing suspicions \xE2\x80\x9Cmakes people more likely\xE2\x80\x9D to report them, Perry said. \"We want to move on suspicions sometimes\" to keep people out of Scouting. \xE2\x80\x9CWe want to act long before convictions.\"</p> <p class=\"p1\">The Boy Scouts' current youth-protection system, with its policy of reporting \"every single instance of suspected child abuse, whether the states require it or not, is better than any other youth-serving organization out there,\xE2\x80\x9D Perry said.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Scouting\xE2\x80\x99s increased emphasis on youth protection comes amid a growing docket of lawsuits filed by Scouts and former Scouts -- and the accompanying negative publicity. Pedophilia scandals in institutions such as the Catholic Church have increased society\xE2\x80\x99s awareness of the threat and intolerance of cover-ups.</p> <p class=\"p1\">The Boy Scouts have been sued in connection with sex abuse more than 100 times since the\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"1980s\" data-scaytid=\"12\">1980s</span>, and at least that many are pending, plaintiff's attorneys representing abuse victims estimate. At least 28 states have no time limit for filing criminal charges related to serious sexual offenses against victims age 15 or younger.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Paul Ernst, the man in charge of the Boy Scouts' confidential files from 1971 until his 1994 retirement, said the records \"kept kids from being abused in any way.\"</p> <p class=\"p1\">\xC2\xA0Interviewed outside his home in Grapevine, Texas, he wore a T-shirt bearing the Scout emblem and proclaiming \"Thanks for the memories.\" Ernst, noting that incidents of molestation were viewed differently 20 or 30 years ago, said he didn't know whether more should have been done then to track predators.</p> <p class=\"p1\">\"I wasn't the policy maker of the Boy Scouts of America, I was just the person handling them,\" he said.</p> <p class=\"p1\">\"I can't look behind me,\" Ernst said. \"... We made decisions then and, as I say, times have changed.\"</p> <p class=\"p1\"> <b>A different era</b></p> <p class=\"p1\">In 1968, after learning that scoutmaster\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\" data-scaytid=\"13\">Treder</span>\xC2\xA0had molested a boy at a Scout camp in Waukesha,\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Wis\" data-scaytid=\"15\">Wis</span>., the Milwaukee County Council banned the West Allis man from Scouting -- but made no report of his conduct to law enforcement nor to the national Boy Scout office.</p> <p class=\"p1\"> <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\" data-scaytid=\"16\">Treder</span>\xC2\xA0later wrote to a council executive, thanking him \xE2\x80\x9Cfor the way you handled everything in Milwaukee. Things could have been much worse for me if you hadn\xE2\x80\x99t kept everything in confidence.\xE2\x80\x9D\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\" data-scaytid=\"17\">Treder</span>\xC2\xA0also wondered whether he somehow could stay involved with Scouts, claiming \xE2\x80\x9Ca gift for working with youth.\xE2\x80\x9D</p> <p class=\"p1\">The executive wrote back that Scouting had no choice but to exclude\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\" data-scaytid=\"20\">Treder</span>, but encouraged him to talk \xE2\x80\x9Cwith your priest and I am sure he can suggest other outlets for your talents.\xE2\x80\x9D</p> <p class=\"p1\">Soon,\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\" data-scaytid=\"22\">Treder</span>\xC2\xA0was overseeing altar boys at St. Aloysius Church in West Allis, where police later determined he molested at least three boys during the\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"1970s\" data-scaytid=\"24\">1970s</span>\xC2\xA0-- and assaulted a 10-year-old boy on Year\xE2\x80\x99s Eve 1983 in a motel room.</p> <p class=\"p1\">The boy delayed reporting the attack until 1989, then drawing police interest in\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\xE2\x80\x99s\" data-scaytid=\"26\">Treder\xE2\x80\x99s</span>\xC2\xA0past association with Scouting. Boy Scouts officials, at the local council and at national headquarters, took until September 1991 to provide detectives with their records. The next month,\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\" data-scaytid=\"25\">Treder</span>\xC2\xA0pleaded guilty to assaulting the boy. He was sentenced to 18 months in jail and 12 years of probation.</p> <p class=\"p1\"> <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\" data-scaytid=\"28\">Treder</span>, approached by Scripps reporters this fall at his home in West Allis, declined to be interviewed.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Efforts to maintain confidentiality about sex offenses within Scouting have sometimes unleashed offenders into other communities.</p> <p class=\"p1\">In 1982, college student Paul S.\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Koefoot\" data-scaytid=\"30\">Koefoot</span>\xC2\xA0served as acting scoutmaster of an Evanston, Ill., troop at a summer camp. Months later, a Scout\xE2\x80\x99s mother wrote to the council executive, complaining that\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Koefoot\" data-scaytid=\"31\">Koefoot</span>\xC2\xA0had carried out\xC2\xA0  <b>\xE2\x80\x9C</b>improper acts\xC2\xA0  <b>\xE2\x80\x9D</b>\xC2\xA0there with her 11-year-old son.</p> <p class=\"p1\">\xE2\x80\x9CMy husband and I feel very strongly that the council should take the necessary actions to ensure that Paul will never again be able to take advantage of a young boy in the Scouting setting,\xE2\x80\x9D she wrote, adding that they would trust the officials to deal with the matter.</p> <p class=\"p1\"> <span data-scayt_word=\"Koefoot\" data-scaytid=\"32\">Koefoot</span>\xC2\xA0was removed from Scouting in June 1983; his file contains no sign of a police report.</p> <p class=\"p1\">In 1997, police in Lincoln, Neb., investigated\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Koefoot\" data-scaytid=\"33\">Koefoot</span>\xC2\xA0on suspicion of molesting 13-year-old Shaun McPherson and at least</p></div> <div class='story last'><p class=\"p1\">10 other boys in his neighborhood.

Based on testimony that he and other boys provided,\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Koefoot\" data-scaytid=\"34\">Koefoot</span>\xC2\xA0was convicted and sentenced to prison in 1998.</p> <p class=\"p1\">McPherson only learned of the earlier allegation this fall, when Scripps reporters visited his home in Lincoln and handed the 28-year-old a copy of\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Koefoot\xE2\x80\x99s\" data-scaytid=\"38\">Koefoot\xE2\x80\x99s</span>\xC2\xA0Boy Scouts file.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Sitting on his stoop, McPherson read its contents, his reaction turning from shock to anger.\xC2\xA0\xE2\x80\x9CAll of this -- with me and these other kids -- could have been prevented a long time ago,\xE2\x80\x9D McPherson said, rubbing his eyes.</p> <p class=\"p1\">\xE2\x80\x9CYou can\xE2\x80\x99t just pass it off to the next person. You can\xE2\x80\x99t just say, \xE2\x80\x98Well, it\xE2\x80\x99s not our problem anymore.\xE2\x80\x99 ...

It happened on your watch!\xE2\x80\x9D</p> <p class=\"p1\">The Boy Scouts \xE2\x80\x9Cneed to be legally responsible for something,\xE2\x80\x9D McPherson added. \xE2\x80\x9CI think they need to go to prison right along with the pedophile. There is no excuse for that.\xE2\x80\x9D</p> <p class=\"p1\"> <b>Molestation by a Scout leader affects everyone in the troop.</b></p> <p class=\"p1\">Adam\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Scheuritzel\" data-scaytid=\"41\">Scheuritzel</span>\xC2\xA0was a 14-year old Star Scout in Ashford, Conn., when his troop went on a\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"campout\" data-scaytid=\"43\">campout</span>\xC2\xA0in March 1987. After the first night, a younger Scout told\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Scheuritzel\" data-scaytid=\"42\">Scheuritzel</span>\xC2\xA0and another youth leader that their scoutmaster had improperly touched an 11- and 12-year-old in their tent.</p> <p class=\"p1\">The youth leaders \xE2\x80\x9Cwent over and talked to them real quick and they were, in fact, inconsolable,\xE2\x80\x9D recalled\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Scheuritzel\" data-scaytid=\"44\">Scheuritzel</span>, now 39. The older boys told their assistant scoutmaster; parents and police were called.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Scoutmaster David Wilson was charged with sexual assault, and more boys came forward with allegations going back months before the\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"campout\" data-scaytid=\"46\">campout</span>.</p> <p class=\"p1\">That spring,\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Scheuritzel\" data-scaytid=\"48\">Scheuritzel</span>\xC2\xA0hand-wrote a short letter\xC2\xA0  <b>t</b>o the advice columnist of Scouting\xE2\x80\x99s magazine:</p> <p class=\"p1\">\xE2\x80\x9C... Our scoutmaster has had to leave our troop for molesting two of our younger Scouts. He molested them physically and us mentally. I was wondering if you would put an article in Boys\xE2\x80\x99 Life mentioning this. ... It may help those who kept it to themselves and tell them it wasn\xE2\x80\x99t their fault.\xE2\x80\x9D</p> <p class=\"p1\">The letter was never published. But it eventually reached Ernst, the keeper of the confidential files, who created a file on Wilson that day. A note on the letter indicates\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Scheuritzel\" data-scaytid=\"50\">Scheuritzel</span>\xC2\xA0got a call from Boy Scout headquarters to reassure him, though he doesn\xE2\x80\x99t recall it.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Wilson pleaded guilty that summer and received a seven-year prison sentence. He died in 2007.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Wilson\xE2\x80\x99s actions devastated the troop,\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Scheuritzel\" data-scaytid=\"52\">Scheuritzel</span>\xC2\xA0said. \xE2\x80\x9CWe got a new scoutmaster, but it (the case) destroyed what we had originally. \xE2\x80\xA6 The Scouts should have stepped up to the plate then and done something\xE2\x80\x9D earlier to stop Wilson.</p> <p class=\"p1\"> <span data-scayt_word=\"Scheuritzel\" data-scaytid=\"54\">Scheuritzel</span>, now a propane-gas technician and volunteer fire marshal, said he and most other troop members left Scouting shortly thereafter, and he still wants nothing more to do with the institution.</p> <p class=\"p1\">One of his three sons wanted to join Scouts a few years back, but\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Scheuritzel\" data-scaytid=\"56\">Scheuritzel</span>\xC2\xA0steered him away. \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s just not something I want to live through again through my kid\xE2\x80\x99s eyes.\xE2\x80\x9D</p> <p class=\"p1\"> <i>(Contact Lee Bowman at bowmanl@scripps.com.)</i></p> </div></div></div>"

    <p>As Hurricane Sandy barrels toward the East Coast, Gov. Deval Patrick held another press conference Sunday afternoon to update the public about Hurricane Sandy, urging residents to stay off the roads and asking communities to close schools.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"Soon the entire commonwealth will feel the effects of the hurricane," Patrick said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>The National Weather Service reports that New England will likely see damaging winds, major flooding and beach erosion.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"To help keep the roads clear for emergency personnel and to keep  people safe from flying limbs and debris or from down power lines, I am  first of all requesting all schools including colleges and early  education programs to close Monday, for the safety of students and  employees alike," Patrick said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Patrick said all non-emergency state workers are asked to stay home Monday, and all state office buildings will be closed.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"And I am encouraging private employers to follow our lead and have their workers stay home as well," Patrick said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency Director Kurt Schwartz said coastal communities are in danger of severe coastal flooding and some may need to be evacuated.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"We have urged the coastal communities to carefully evaluate the  storm surge that is being predicted and to map out those areas of their  communities that are at risk of flooding and to take appropriate action  including notifying residents of those areas, businesses of those areas,  and if necessary to impose voluntary or mandatory evacuation areas," Schwartz said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Schwartz  pointed out the south shore, particularly in the New Bedford area and Buzzard's Bay, which  may see a storm surge of up to 10 feet. Other areas along the coast may  see storm surges of up to 6 feet. There will likely be pockets of severe flooding in many coastal communities.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Widespread power outages are likely, and Patrick said there may be an  even bigger impact on service than the state had during Hurricane Irene  last year.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Patrick emphasized the need for community cooperation during and after the storm, especially regarding keeping the roads clear and staying updated on conditions.</p><p>&#13;

    </p><p>Hurricane Sandy is expected to affect as many as 50 million people as it makes its westward turn toward the East Coast.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>While the most recent maps show the center of the storm tracking toward New Jersey, forecasters are hesitant to pinpoint a specific area for landfall.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Rick Knabb, director of the National Hurricane Center, said forecasters are still looking for the storm to come ashore somewhere between the Delmarva coastline and Rhode Island.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Knabb cautioned the public not to focus on the track of the center of the storm or that it is a category one hurricane.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"I don't want folks to focus on the time of arrival because conditions are already starting to go down hill in coastal areas," said Knabb. "The system is large and of long duration...it could be a two-day event in many locations including inland locations."</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Heavy winds are expected from the Carolinas to New England through the middle of the week. Those winds are expected to cause massive power outages.

    </p><p>Storm and tidal surges will combine along the coast and could produce flooding as much as 11 feet above ground level.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Knabb said forecasters predict <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ftowson.patch.com%2farticles%2fstorm-surge-inland-flooding-expected-from-sandy">inland flooding will become a problem</a> early on during the storm especially in Maryland and Pennsylvania.

                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; The Republican and Democratic candidates for New Hampshire governor are using a tried and true strategy in their campaigns: Frame their opponent&rsquo;s views on issues.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Republican gubernatorial candidate Ovide Lamontagne is using a reliable GOP election strategy of trying to pin a tax-and-spend, liberal Democrat label on rival Maggie Hassan.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Lamontagne points to state budgets Hassan helped write as a state senator that contained tax and fee hikes as proof voters can expect more of the same if she&rsquo;s elected. Lamontagne insists voters can&rsquo;t trust Hassan&rsquo;s word to veto a personal income or general sales tax.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Hassan is adopting a common Democratic strategy by portraying Lamontagne as an extremist with tea party ties who would take away the rights of women to make health care decisions and the rights of gays to marry.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Hassan said Lamontagne is deceiving voters by not discussing social issues or including his staunch opposition to abortion and gay marriage on his campaign website.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;The narratives fit in with the national narratives of the two parties,&rsquo;&rsquo; said political analyst Dean Spiliotes, who writes for NHPoliticalCapital.com.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Republican Party candidates argue Democrats will raise taxes and spend money, he said. Democratic Party candidates say GOP rivals are linked to the tea party and too socially conservative.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Trying to cement his point with voters, Lamontagne&rsquo;s campaign issues daily releases titled &lsquo;&lsquo;Maggie&rsquo;s Taxes of the Day&rsquo;&rsquo; with a list of fees or taxes in budgets passed when Hassan was in the Senate.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In response, Hassan has repeated her promise to veto a personal income or general sales tax. She focuses on how the budgets she worked on were balanced without enacting either tax.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;We balanced the budget and left a surplus,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Hassan offers very few examples of revenue measures she would support to produce a balanced budget if elected. She would reinstate a 10 cent-per-pack cut in the cigarette tax made by the Republican Legislature and beef up the auditing division to boost business tax receipts &mdash; another area the GOP cut.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Lamontagne contrasts Hassan&rsquo;s openness to those revenue measures with his vow not to raise any taxes and to find places in the budget to cut to offset proposed business tax cuts and spending increases. Hassan points out he has not said what he would cut to pay for millions of dollars in revenue cutting or spending proposals.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Both support a high-end casino near the Massachusetts border.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In fact, Republican and Democratic legislatures commonly used a variety of small tax and fee hikes over the years to balance budgets. That changed with the current conservative Republican Legislature, which did not raise taxes and instead made deep cuts, particularly in aid to hospitals and public colleges.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In attempting to frame Lamontagne for voters, Hassan points to his record running for the U.S. Senate in 2010 when he proudly campaigned on his conservative positions.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>She also tries to tie Lamontagne to the conservative group Cornerstone and its legislative agenda, which the group says it expects pledge signers to support. Lamontagne has signed the group&rsquo;s Families First Pledge, which includes bills to limit abortion, allow companies to deny a service to customers if it violates business owners&rsquo; religious beliefs, repeal New Hampshire&rsquo;s gay marriage law and create a religious exemption to contraceptive coverage in health policies.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Lamontagne signed the pledge that in general supports those principles, but he insists that though he supports conservative principles, he has not read Cornerstone&rsquo;s legislative agenda.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Those issues are not central to this election. This election is about jobs and the economy,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;&lsquo;Social issues are not foremost on people&rsquo;s minds.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>As governor, Lamontagne said he would lack the power to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court decision that makes abortion legal anyway, he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Hassan says his dismissal of social issues is disingenuous since conservative lawmakers already have filed bills to limit access to abortions that the next governor could find on his or her desk. Legislation to repeal gay marriage also is expected to be filed. She insists it is a mistake to try to separate social issues from a discussion on jobs and the economy.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know a woman in New Hampshire who believes that if she has to pay more for health care it is a social issue,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;&lsquo;If people who want to get married can&rsquo;t get married, that&rsquo;s an economic issue.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Andy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, said Hassan&rsquo;s strategy is the tougher sell because &mdash; with so much attention focused on the presidential race &mdash; it is harder to get voters&rsquo; attention. Lamontagne has an easier time playing to voters&rsquo; anti-tax sentiment because of the state&rsquo;s long history of opposing income and sales taxes, he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;The argument Maggie is making is largely to the Democratic base, to people who would vote Democratic anyway,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.<img alt="end of story marker" border="0" height="8" width="6" src="http://www.boston.com/r/SysConfig/WebPortal/Boston/Framework/images/site_graphics/dingbat_story_end_icon.gif" class="storyend"></p>

  content: "<div><div><p>Dr. Edward (Ned) Shilling Hodgson, of Concord, a renowned neurophysiologist who was the first to record electrical signals from a single cell, established fundamental principles of taste, and later determined how sharks find and attack humans in the sea through smell, has died following a brief illness on October 22. He was 85. \xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Born in Wilmington, Delaware, on October 28, 1926 Hodgson developed an early interest in biology and music, studying piano with Percy Grainger. As a graduate student at Johns Hopkins working with Vincent Detheir, he wanted to understand how animals\xE2\x80\x99 nerves can detect taste. He refined the skills needed to make his own glass electrodes and became a microsurgeon in order to record nerve impulses from microscopic taste receptor cells in houseflies.\xC2\xA0 Because the cells were so small, he placed one cell inside a homemade glass electrode to make the recording resulting in a classic 1951 paper in Science. During later work at Columbia and Tufts Universities in the 1950s and 1960s, he discovered that inhibition or blocking of nerve transmission is a fundamental feature of how the nervous system works and can determine animal behavior.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In the late 1960s, Hodgson was asked by the US Navy to help them determine how sharks locate wounded soldiers lost at sea after battles. During the Battle of the Coral sea hundreds of military personnel were believed to have been eaten by sharks. Hodgson established a research program at the Lerner Marine Laboratory in Bimini, Bahamas and was able to determine the important role that sight, sound, smell and electrical signals from specialized organs located under the snout of sharks, play in allowing sharks to locate prey in the water.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>While a Professor and later Chair of Biology at Tufts University, Hodgson was one of the first to take university biology students out to sea and introduce them to marine biology through \xE2\x80\x9Cimmersion learning.\xE2\x80\x9D \xC2\xA0This led to a new research path into coral reef science.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>His wife of 54 years, Valorie Simpson Hodgson, also a marine biologist, passed away in 2003. Hodgson is survived by two sons, Karl of Eagan, MN and Gregor of Calabasas, CA and three grandchildren Cara, Tasha and Richard.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A memorial service will be held at Tufts University at a time and date to be announced.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>This week's <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexington.patch.com%2fcolumns%2fhome-of-the-week-3c52df2c">Lexington Home of the Week</a>, is well, not one home, but three. This breathtaking land, locally known as the Otis Emery Mulliken Property, was divided into three condominium homes in the 1980s: the main house into two units and the barn. The current owners of all three units initially bought number 221 and eventually as the other two residences became available, purchased all three with the intention of converting the main house into one large residence. Now relocating, they are pleased to offer this distinctive prospect to another fortunate owner.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>As visitors travel up a long, circular drive, they are greeted by a beautiful estate majestically resting on a lush, private one and a half acre knoll. A magnificent 43-foot front porch awaits as a fitting introduction and the perfect setting to view the celebrated historic oak tree that has been proudly standing since the revolutionary war.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>The handsome period entrance with a double sets of leaded doors lends a hint as to what awaits inside of Unit 1. The long, gracious foyer leads to a formal living room with original built-ins, a carved fireplace and sun drenched solarium. The banquet-sized dining area offers a bay of oversized windows and opens into a state-of-the-art kitchen with granite surfaces and stainless steel appliances. A gracious staircase leads to the second level which includes three bedrooms, including a master suite with a walk-in closet and a full, private bath and an office with a spectacular leaded glass entrance.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Unit 2 offers a private entrance on the left side of the main house and boasts a sophisticated four-bedroom residence among three levels. The first floor offers a bright, eat-in kitchen, dining area, charming fireplaced living room and a bedroom and full bath for residents who prefer or require single-floor living. Two bedrooms and a full bath are located on the second level and another bedroom, full bath and large study on the third story.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Unit 3, the barn, somehow manages to convey a dramatic statement yet still retains its rustic charm. This four-story structure boasts exquisite details, including soaring beamed ceilings, sliding barn doors and incredibly elegant spaces. Its open floor plan is large enough for fluid entertaining with a soapstone and stainless steel kitchen opening into an airy dining area and the barn door can even be opened for refreshing alfresco dining. There is a first floor bedroom and bath on this level as well as a separate one-bedroom apartment. The second level includes three bedrooms, two full baths, a large balcony and sitting area and the third story studio flaunts amazing built-ins for storage.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>This magnificent property is located in the center of Lexington, but residents will feel as if they are in an enchanting world of their own. The grounds and resourceful site and egresses for all three units allow privacy for all so this estate would make an excellent real estate investment or the ideal solution for extended families. This is an incredibly unique opportunity to obtain and experience a significant slice of Lexington's legendary history.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Location:</strong> 221-225 Waltham St.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $2.8 million</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Units on Property:</strong> 3</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Lot Size: </strong>1.42 acres</p><p>&#13;

  title: Benn challenges Atkins for state representative
  community_id: "34"

    <div><div>
    					<div class="firstGraph">
    <p>State Representative Cory Atkins,&nbsp;a Concord Democrat who believes the state is doing a lot of things right, is seeking a seventh term in a race against Republican challenger Michael J. Benn,&nbsp;who says the one-party control on Beacon Hill has government &ldquo;out of balance.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Atkins, 65, and Benn, 47, are vying to represent the 14th Middlesex District, which covers all of Concord and Carlisle, and parts of Acton and Chelmsford.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Benn, who grew up in Concord, has served on the town&rsquo;s Public Ceremonies and Celebrations Committee,&nbsp;is active in the Knights of Columbus and in his church, where he taught Catholic religious education, and spent time coaching his children&rsquo;s youth soccer teams.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>After graduating from Northeastern University and earning a master&rsquo;s degree in business administration from Boston University, he spent his career working in health care finance, Benn said. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a total product of the private sector,&rdquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Benn said he views government from the perspectives of a parent, student, taxpayer, and someone who has worked in business for 24 years.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;These are the customers of government, and the customer should always be right,&rdquo; he said, adding that state government has lost sight of this.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Benn said the primary reason he&rsquo;s running is to get those who are &ldquo;stuck in the unemployment cycle&rdquo; back to work and to boost the economy. <span>&ldquo;These are real people with real needs who need good food on their plate and a good roof over their head,&rdquo; he said.</span>
    
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Bringing the state income tax rate and sales tax back down to 5 percent is a good starting point in restoring a thriving state economy, he said.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>He emphasized that he does not advocate for a lower tax rate to simply &ldquo;put a few more dollars in my pocket,&rdquo; but to provide the economic stimulus necessary for small businesses to thrive and create jobs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Many people who live near the New Hampshire border, and many from the 14th Middlesex District, drive over the state line to avoid the 6&frac14; percent sales tax in Massachusetts.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;When that happens, the state loses revenue from the whole sale,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Businesses lose sales and unemployment goes up.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The second thing on Benn&rsquo;s economic agenda is to get spending under control.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Legislators should take the same approach to creating a budget as people in the private sector, which is to start at zero and require those requesting funds to justify each dollar being asked for, Benn said. 
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;We all maybe do more than we would have liked to do with less money than we would have liked to do it with,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But the job gets done.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Benn said if legislators worked together on Beacon Hill as well as individuals do in the private sector, things in government would get done more efficiently. &ldquo;But some people are doing things for their own political gain,&rdquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Atkins, who was first elected to Beacon Hill in a special election in 1999, said the state&rsquo;s economy is a lot better than in many parts of the country.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;Our bond rating is double A plus, one of only three states with that rating, we are ranked first in education .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and our rainy day fund is over $1 billion,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That gives us a real advantage in attracting business and creating jobs.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Atkins said that while the state has an innovative economy, it also has a cold climate, which can be a turnoff for companies looking for a place to locate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;But what attracts businesses here is our quality of life and our education system,&rdquo; she said.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>She said legislation passed during the last session, including health care cost containment, a jobs bill, and a move to streamline the permitting process for companies to build here, will help spur growth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>But another key issue, Atkins said, is public transportation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>She said the approximately $20 billion deficit in that department is something that can no longer be pushed aside, and balancing the budget &ldquo;is going to take a large, dedicated revenue stream.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>She said her first priority will be to make sure the concerns of the people in her district are represented, but that she is not ruling out voting in favor of a tax increase or new revenue stream that would specifically be used to balance the transportation budget.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a grown-up,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Santa Claus is not going to appear and fix this. I wish he were, but we are going to have to fix this and we are going to have to pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Another thing Atkins says needs fixing is campaign finance laws that allow companies to pour unlimited amounts of money directly into political advertisements.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="">
    <p>Atkins sponsored legislation calling for lawmakers in Washington to respond to a US Supreme Court ruling that allows for the unfettered corporate contributions.

  content: "<div><div><p><i>Energizer</i>\xC2\xA0and International Association of Fire Chiefs Honor Silver Anniversary with Adoption of 25 Fire Departments and Donation of 250,000 Batteries across the Country</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The message is simple, and the habit can be lifesaving. Thirty-eight percent of fatal fire injuries occur in homes without working smoke alarms, while 24 percent occur in homes in which at least one smoke alarm is present but fails to operate, frequently due to dead or missing batteries.* For 25 years, the\xC2\xA0<i>Change Your Clock Change Your Battery</i><sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>program has been dedicated to helping share the life-saving reminder to change the batteries in your home\xE2\x80\x99s smoke and carbon monoxide detectors when you change your clocks for daylight savings.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>This year,\xC2\xA0<i>Energizer</i>\xC2\xA0and the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC) will mark the silver anniversary of one of the nation\xE2\x80\x99s top home fire safety programs by donating 250,000<i>Energizer<sub>\xC2\xAE</sub></i>\xC2\xA0MAX<sub>\xC2\xAE\xC2\xA0</sub>batteries to fire departments across the country to distribute to local families in their areas and adopting 25 fire departments in 25 cities across the nation, who, in addition to batteries, will be equipped with a variety<i>Energizer</i><sub>\xC2\xAE</sub>\xC2\xA0family safety products for their department and to share in their communities. Together, they will host Home Safety Days and neighborhood canvasses spanning throughout National Fire Prevention Month in October until the end of daylight saving time on Sunday, Nov. 4.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CIn the past 25 years, the number of home fire deaths has substantially decreased,\xE2\x80\x9D said Chief Hank Clemmensen, IAFC president and chairman of the board. \xE2\x80\x9CThat success is mostly thanks to the thousands of hours\xE2\x80\x94every year for 25 years\xE2\x80\x94that local fire departments have dedicated to improving the safety environment through technology, policy and, especially, public education efforts like the\xC2\xA0<i>Change Your Clock Change Your Battery<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>\xC2\xA0</i>program. But the world does not stand still, local fire department budgets are shrinking, many people still don\xE2\x80\x99t have a basic baseline of protection from smoke alarms, and we must keep pace with changes in technology and the built environment, It\xE2\x80\x99s still vital that homes be equipped with working smoke detectors in order to give families those critical extra seconds to escape.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>There are currently 23 million homes at risk of a fire because\xE2\x80\x94although they have smoke alarms\xE2\x80\x94the alarms are not functioning, mostly due to dead or missing batteries. Sharing the reminder to Change Your Clock Change Your Battery<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>\xC2\xA0is a simple way to help protect neighbors and loved ones. \xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CWe began the\xC2\xA0<i>Change Your Clock Change Your Battery</i><sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>program with the IAFC 25 years ago to do our part in helping to keep families safe, \xE2\x80\x9Csaid Michelle Atkinson, Vice President of Marketing for\xC2\xA0<i>Energizer</i>\xC2\xA0North America. \xE2\x80\x9CToday it\xE2\x80\x99s amazing to look back and see how the more than four million batteries donated through hundreds of neighborhood canvasses has translated to countless lives being saved. It\xE2\x80\x99s another example of our philosophy of\xC2\xA0<i>that\xE2\x80\x99s positivenergy</i><sub>\xE2\x84\xA2</sub>\xC2\xA0brought to life. We are grateful to the IAFC and local fire departments across the country for helping us share this message and make a positive impact.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The 25<sup>th</sup>\xC2\xA0anniversary of Change Your Clock Change Your Battery<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>\xC2\xA0kicked off Oct. 1 in Chicago, where the Chicago Fire Department was joined by MLB Hall of Famer and\xC2\xA0<i>that\xE2\x80\x99s positivenergy</i><sub>\xE2\x84\xA2</sub>\xC2\xA0Ambassador Cal Ripken, Jr. to honor the anniversary of the Great Chicago Fire. The Energizer Bunny<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>Brigade recreated the scene of the O\xE2\x80\x99Leary Barn, where by legend the fire started, and firefighters provided a fire safety demonstration for local students. Following, Ripken led the first of the neighborhood canvasses with fire officials in Southside Chicago who conducted fire safety inspections and surprised homeowners with Family Safety Kits, stocked with products designed to help keep homes safe including Kidde smoke detectors,\xC2\xA0<i>Energizer</i><sub>\xC2\xAE\xC2\xA0</sub>MAX<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>\xC2\xA0batteries and\xC2\xA0<i>Energizer</i><sub>\xC2\xAE</sub>Weatheready<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>\xC2\xA0flashlights.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The<i>\xC2\xA0Change Your Clock Change Your Battery<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup></i><sup>\xC2\xA0</sup>program is just one of the ways\xC2\xA0<i>Energizer</i>\xC2\xA0brings to life the company\xE2\x80\x99s commitment to making a positive impact in communities across the country.\xC2\xA0<i>that\xE2\x80\x99s positivenergy<sub>\xE2\x84\xA2</sub></i></p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>As Hurricane Sandy barrels toward the East Coast, Gov. Deval Patrick held another press conference Sunday afternoon to update the public about Hurricane Sandy, urging residents to stay off the roads and asking communities to close schools.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"Soon the entire commonwealth will feel the effects of the hurricane," Patrick said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>The National Weather Service reports that New England will likely see damaging winds, major flooding and beach erosion.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"To help keep the roads clear for emergency personnel and to keep  people safe from flying limbs and debris or from down power lines, I am  first of all requesting all schools including colleges and early  education programs to close Monday, for the safety of students and  employees alike," Patrick said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Patrick said all non-emergency state workers are asked to stay home Monday, and all state office buildings will be closed.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"And I am encouraging private employers to follow our lead and have their workers stay home as well," Patrick said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency Director Kurt Schwartz said coastal communities are in danger of severe coastal flooding and some may need to be evacuated.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"We have urged the coastal communities to carefully evaluate the  storm surge that is being predicted and to map out those areas of their  communities that are at risk of flooding and to take appropriate action  including notifying residents of those areas, businesses of those areas,  and if necessary to impose voluntary or mandatory evacuation areas," Schwartz said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Schwartz  pointed out the south shore, particularly in the New Bedford area and Buzzard's Bay, which  may see a storm surge of up to 10 feet. Other areas along the coast may  see storm surges of up to 6 feet. There will likely be pockets of severe flooding in many coastal communities.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Widespread power outages are likely, and Patrick said there may be an  even bigger impact on service than the state had during Hurricane Irene  last year.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Patrick emphasized the need for community cooperation during and after the storm, especially regarding keeping the roads clear and staying updated on conditions.</p><p>&#13;

  community_id: "30"

  content: "<div><div>\r\n\
    \t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"byline\"><p class=\"byline\">By Chelsea Conaboy, Globe Staff</p></p>\r\n\
    \t\t\t\t\t<p>Dr. Ben Warf thought the prospects were poor that Ugandan children with hydrocephalus, or an excess of water on the brain, could be successfully treated by implanting a drainage tube. Families he cared for at a Mbale hospital had limited access to health care. A blockage in the tube, called a shunt, could be disastrous. </p>\n\
    <p>In the early 2000s, Warf devised an alternative that reduced the number of infants who needed brain shunts by about two-thirds. It became the standard of care at Boston Children\xE2\x80\x99s Hospital, where he directs the Neonatal and Congenital Anomaly Neurosurgery Program. Now Warf is unraveling the causes of hydrocephalus, work he hopes could lead to prevention. </p>\n\
    <p>The 54-year-old from Lexington has been named a 2012 MacArthur Foundation Fellow, one of four Boston-area recipients of the \xE2\x80\x9Cgenius grant.\xE2\x80\x9D The award comes with a $500,000 stipend and, for Warf, visibility for a global health problem that he said has been \xE2\x80\x9Cway under the radar.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\
    <p>Warf grew up in the Appalachian Mountains of Eastern Kentucky, the son of a Southern Baptist pastor with a strong interest in science. He graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1984 and was drawn to pediatric neurosurgery in part by his love of children. He and his wife, Cindy, have six of their own. </p>\n\
    <p>The pair decided in early 2000 to act on Warf\xE2\x80\x99s longtime dream of being a medical missionary. He had made some short trips to Kenya with CURE International, a Christian organization that provides surgical care in developing nations, and in March of that year the couple moved their family to Uganda, where he would help to open a hospital specializing in neurosurgery. </p>\n\
    <p>With high rates of childbirth, little perinatal care, and even less access to surgical specialists, Warf found the demand for his skills was high. \xE2\x80\x9CImmediately, it became obvious that we were going to be very busy,\xE2\x80\x9D he said.</p>\n\
    <p>Cindy Warf said her husband worried about leaving academic medicine in the United States. He thought he would have to leave his love of research behind. Instead, he found the focus of his professional life.</p>\n\
    <p>Warf was unhappy with placing shunts in Ugandan patients. In the United States, about half of shunts fail within two years, and some children endure scores of operations. </p>\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CWe felt hard-pressed to try to avoid shunt dependence,\xE2\x80\x9D Warf said.</p>\n\
    <p>Warf tested a combination of techniques that alone had been mostly ineffective in treating infants with hydrocephalus. He cauterized tissues in the brain to slow the production of fluid and made small openings in the base of the brain to allow fluid to drain into the cavity around it. Warf and colleagues followed patients over time and <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2fpubmed%2f22044377\">found the method was effective</a>. </p>\n\
    <p>Researchers have estimated that about three of every 1,000 children born in sub-Saharan Africa develop hydrocephalus after an infection. Ward knew that was the primary cause in his patients. He collected fluid samples that were tested at Pennsylvania State University and found to include bacterial DNA.   </p>\n\
    <p>When researchers overlaid data Warf had collected with weather patterns for the region, they found that the incidence of infection rose and fell with changes in rainfall, pointing to an environmental pathogen. </p>\n\
    <p>Now Warf and colleagues are partnering with a hospital and medical school in western Uganda to follow mothers and babies from birth to six months of age to learn more about those who develop hydrocephalus. </p>\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CThere\xE2\x80\x99s a lot that we don\xE2\x80\x99t know,\xE2\x80\x9D he said.</p>\n\
    <p>With funding from CURE, Warf has trained 20 neurosurgeons, mostly in Africa. They were outfitted with laptops to track their work. Warf hopes their data will provide a more global look at the condition and the various pathogens that could cause it. </p>\n\
    <p>The MacArthur award will further that goal, he said, allowing him to spend more time in Africa and on research projects based in the United States. </p>\r\n\

    </p><p><em>At Patch we're always trying to pull together into one place all of the best local resources on every topic, including books and reading, and we have the good fortune to be working with a best-selling author James Patterson in this endeavor, and we'll be sharing his reading list selections for every age here on Patch. Plus, we'll showcase reading lists from our local librarians, bookstores, and you\xE2\x80\x94our readers. But here, an open letter to moms and dads of reluctant readers from James Patterson.</em></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Dear Moms and Dads,</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>I\xE2\x80\x99ve had the good fortune to meet hundreds of teachers and librarians around the country. They always wow me with their tips and tricks to get kids into reading. I thought it was time to get these great ideas out in the open so you all can use them at home.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>So, we asked teachers and librarians to send us their ways for successfully turning reluctant kids into hooked readers. There are many methods, but, interesting to me, is that there are a half dozen overarching ones from which to work. Go ahead \xE2\x80\x94 give these a shot at home with your kids:</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\xA2 After a kid has read a book, listen\xE2\x80\x94really listen\xE2\x80\x94to what he has to say about it. Show him that his opinions matter and that you respect his judgment.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\xA2 Make books \xE2\x80\x94 lots of them \xE2\x80\x94 available. Go the library. Go to book sales. Go to bookstores.\xC2\xA0Give your kiddo many books you\xE2\x80\x99ve selected especially for him to choose from.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\xA2 Reward reading. With prizes, with privileges, with praise.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\xA2 Set the rules and expectations \xE2\x80\x94 how much time, how many books. Your children will rise to your expectations.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\xA2 However old they are, read to your children or read with them. Talk about the books you\xE2\x80\x99re sharing chapter-by-chapter so that you are both responsible to keep the conversation going.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\xA2 New habits are too easy to break. Don\xE2\x80\x99t stop any of this when your kids become those avid readers. They need your consistent support.</p><p>&#13;\n\

That&rsquo;s probably the best from start to finish energy-wise and confidence-wise that our team showed since we&rsquo;ve been here. It was a lot of fun.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><span>But one word immediately wiped all the smiles off their faces during Monday&rsquo;s press conference.</span></p> <p><span>Akron.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s pretty pumped up, but now we just gotta keep it going,&rdquo; said KSU junior defensive end Mark Fackler. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t celebrate. We gotta get ready for Akron now.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><span>The Flashes will meet their struggling rival on Saturday at Dix Stadium (2 p.m.), a matchup that makes putting the Rutgers victory behind them all the easier.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;I really like the fact that our guys came off last week and the first thing on their mind (Sunday) at the team meeting was, it&rsquo;s (Akron) time,&rdquo; said Hazell.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;This is what we&rsquo;ve waited on. A rivalry game, it&rsquo;s a 365-day commitment. You do all of those things in the off-season because of this week, this one day. One team will be able to walk around for 365 days prideful, and the other one has to walk differently.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very important game, and we let that be known.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><span>The two rivals are currently heading in opposite directions, with Kent State riding a seven-game winning streak while the Zips (1-8, 0-5) have just one win on the season and have dropped six in a row. Still, Hazell isn&rsquo;t worried one bit about his Flashes overlooking Akron.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no concern of a letdown,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This team is very mature. They prepare very hard every week, and each contest is its own entity. I&rsquo;m very confident that our guys will prepare hard for this game.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;Obviously it&rsquo;s a throw-out-the-records game. When you&rsquo;re playing in any type of rivalry, you better play as hard as you possibly can play.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><strong>HOW TO BEAT A RIVAL</strong></p> <p><span>Hazell knows plenty about how to succeed in rivalries, after helping Ohio State go 7-0 against Michigan in his seven years as an assistant coach with the Buckeyes (2004-10) under Jim Tressel.</span></p> <p><span>Does he put some of the lessons he learned about rivalries from Tressel to use?</span></p> <p><span>Absolutely,&rdquo; said Hazell.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some things practice-wise that we&rsquo;ll do this week that we did at my last job. Not so much schematic things, just preparation-wise and some of the mindset things that you have to have when you&rsquo;re going into a rivalry.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><span>Hazell&rsquo;s Flashes defeated Akron 35-3 in his first season as head coach last year. Kent State has won the last two matchups with the Zips, and will seek its first three-game winning streak in the rivalry since 1952-54.</span></p> <p><strong>BOOTS APLENTY</strong></p> <p><span>Although the Flashes managed to escape Rutgers virtually injury-free, three star players will be wearing walking boots once again this week &mdash; junior speedster Dri Archer, senior kicker Freddy Cortez and junior defensive tackle Roosevelt Nix.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gotta lot of boots right now throughout the course of the week,&rdquo; said Hazell. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all precautionary, so they don&rsquo;t stress that part of the ankle. They&rsquo;ll all be ready to go.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><span>Cortez injured an ankle last week, then was hit by a Scarlet Knights defender while kicking an extra point on Saturday.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;Freddy&rsquo;s a little bit bumped up, but he&rsquo;ll be fine by Saturday,&rdquo; said Hazell. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll rest him for a couple days, and he&rsquo;ll be ready to go.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><span>Hazell used Cortez as an example of his team&rsquo;s vastly improved overall toughness.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a lot of guys that are get-back-in guys, where a year ago at the beginning part of the season a guy would get nicked up, and he&rsquo;d look for a way to stay on the sideline,&rdquo; said Hazell. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got guys on the team now, they come hobbling off and before you know it they&rsquo;re trying to get back in the football game. That speaks to their toughness, it speaks to how important the team is, it speaks to just the importance of everything that&rsquo;s going on in this program right now. Freddy is one of those guys. After they ran into him on one of those extra points, I told (assistant coach Jafar) Williams to have (punter Anthony) Melchiori kick the kickoff. Coach Williams comes running down the sidelines and says Freddy wants to kickoff. I said let him.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;You look at the little things throughout the course of your program and where you&rsquo;re getting a little bit more improvement, and that&rsquo;s one of those things. That&rsquo;s why I like this football team so much. It&rsquo;s nice to be around.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><strong>PRAISE FOR DURHAM</strong></p> <p><span>Hazell heaped praise on sophomore running back Trayion Durham for his performance against the Scarlet Knights. Even though he fumbled twice, with the second drop coming after a long run in the fourth quarter when Kent State was on the verge of putting the game away.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;I think he was a little bit loose with the ball on both of those, the ball was out a little bit,&rdquo; said Hazell. &ldquo;Especially in the last situation, we can&rsquo;t put the ball on the ground. He makes a great run and the guy gets him from the side. He should have rolled that thing high and tight on that last one.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><span>Aside from the fumbles, Durham rushed 22 times for a career-high 131 yards and a touchdown against a Rutgers defense that had not allowed a 100-yard rusher this season.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;The impressive thing about Trayion is that he&rsquo;s getting better each week, and he&rsquo;s hungrier each week to get better,&rdquo; said Hazell. &ldquo;He and I had a text exchange (Sunday). I said I thought this is the hardest you&rsquo;ve run since you&rsquo;ve been here. I thought your pads were going in the right direction, I thought you were good in the hole. And his response back to me was, &lsquo;coach, I gotta play a lot better.&rsquo;</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;It was great to see that response,&rdquo; Hazell said</span></p><p><strong>MAC HONORS BATTON</strong></p> <p><span>Senior linebacker Luke Batton was named MAC East Division Defensive Player of the Week after recording seven tackles, a sack, an interception and tipping a pass that was intercepted against Rutgers. If the MAC had a Defensive Player of the Month it would have to be Batton, who compiled 47 tackles, two fumble recoveries &mdash; one of which he returned 83 yards for a touchdown &mdash; two interceptions and two deflected passes that were picked off by teammates in four games during October.</span></p></p></div>
  summary: It's been 39 years since it's felt this good to be a member of the Kent State football program.

    </p><p>Federal emergency management and weather officials said Sunday that the time to prepare for Hurricane Sandy is rapidly coming to an end.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"The time for preparing and talking is about over," said Craig Fugate, adminstrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. People need to be acting about now."</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Hurricane Sandy is expected to affect as many as 50 million people as it makes its westward turn toward the East Coast.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>While the most recent maps show the center of the storm tracking toward New Jersey, forecasters are hesitant to pinpoint a specific area for landfall.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Rick Knabb, director of the National Hurricane Center, said forecasters are still looking for the storm to come ashore somewhere between the Delmarva coastline and Rhode Island.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Knabb cautioned the public not to focus on the track of the center of the storm or that it is a category one hurricane.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"I don't want folks to focus on the time of arrival because conditions are already starting to go down hill in coastal areas," said Knabb. "The system is large and of long duration...it could be a two-day event in many locations including inland locations."</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Heavy winds are expected from the Carolinas to New England through the middle of the week. Those winds are expected to cause massive power outages. One estimate from Johns Hopkins University places the number of <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2farbutus.patch.com%2farticles%2f10-million-may-lose-power-in-storm">estimated outages at 10 million</a> along the Mid-Atlantic to New England.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>In Maryland, <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ftowson.patch.com%2farticles%2fabout-2-000-out-of-state-utility-workers-recruited-for-storm-recovery-efforts">BGE</a> and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fgermantown.patch.com%2farticles%2fpepco-bge-prepare-for-hurricane-sandy">PEPCO</a> have brought in crews from as far away as New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Storm and tidal surges will combine along the coast and could produce flooding as much as 11 feet above ground level.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Knabb said forecasters predict <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ftowson.patch.com%2farticles%2fstorm-surge-inland-flooding-expected-from-sandy">inland flooding will become a problem</a> early on during the storm especially in Maryland and Pennsylvania.

    <p><em>On Halloween night, many parents struggle with getting their kids to eat something beside sweets while fulfilling their own adult responsibilities and having fun themselves. All of the recipes that follow can easily be completely prepared or fully prepped either before trick-or-treating or while answering the door and handing out goodies. Alternately, most of these recipes are simple enough to allow for little helpers to assist in the preparation while they wait for it to get dark enough to go out.</em></p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><ul><li>Hot dogs </li>&#13;\n\

    <li>Per bug, select 8 \xE2\x80\x93 10 longer potato sticks for legs and 2 short ones for antennae and insert into dough while it is still warm.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Serve with blood (ketchup) or other condiments as desired (you can make up your own gross/scary names for mayonnaise, mustard, relish, etc).</li>&#13;\n\
    </ol><p><i>Note: These can be baking while you are doing the stovetop preparation of the quesadilla recipe that follows: just turn the broiler on after you take out the \xE2\x80\x9Cbugs in a blanket.\xE2\x80\x9D</i></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><h2>Jack O\xE2\x80\x99Lantern Quesadillas</h2><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><i>These are inspired by a recipe on the \xE2\x80\x9C<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.allyou.com%2ffood%2frecipes%2fhalloween-menu-00400000054457%2fpage16.html\">all*you</a>\xE2\x80\x9D website. </i></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>Ingredients:</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ul><li>Tortillas (if you can find orange ones- like <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fnewton.patch.com%2flistings%2ftrader-joes-152\">Trader Joe\xE2\x80\x99s</a> Habanero Lime or Maria and Ricardo\xE2\x80\x99s Tomato &amp; Basil- they work best) (2 per person)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Shredded cheese (I used Colby-Jack) (1/2 cup per person)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Canola oil</li>&#13;\n\
    </ul><p><b>Directions:</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ol><li>Turn oven to broil (after making \xE2\x80\x9Cbugs\xE2\x80\x9D) or preheat to broil.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Cover baking sheets with foil (you will need approximately 1 baking sheet for every 2-3 quesadillas).</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Stack up 4 tortillas at a time on a cutting board and use a sharp paring knife to trim away some of top, leaving a 1-inch \"stem\" so tortillas are shaped like pumpkins. Repeat with remaining tortillas. </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Use knife to cut two triangles for eyes and a crescent for a mouth in half the tortillas (the remaining tortillas will be on the bottom so you do not want holes in them).</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Heat approximately 1 teaspoon of oil in a large pan over medium heat.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Add a tortilla without eyes and mouth, heat briefly, flip, and cover with 1/2 cup cheese.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Cover with jack o\xE2\x80\x99lantern tortilla. Cook until underside is golden, 1 to 2 minutes, and then slide onto baking sheet. Repeat until baking sheet is full.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Place baking sheet under broiler and broil until tops are golden (Watch carefully- this only takes a minute or so).</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Repeat to make remaining quesadillas<b>.</b><b> <br></b></li>&#13;\n\
    </ol><h2>Owl S\xE2\x80\x99mores</h2><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><i>These were based on a recipe found on Amy Locurto\xE2\x80\x99s website, \xE2\x80\x9C<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.livinglocurto.com%2f2010%2f09%2fowl-smores%2f\">Living Locurto</a>.\xE2\x80\x9D</i></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>Ingredients:</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ul><li>Graham crackers (broken in two to form squares- you will need 1 sq. per owl)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Full-sized marshmallows (1 per owl)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Mini chocolate chips (2 per owl)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Candy corn (1 per owl)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Yellow frosting (I used the kind that comes in a tube and a small decorating tip, but you can make your own)</li>&#13;\n\
    </ul><p><b>Directions:</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ol><li>Using a sharp knife or kitchen shears, cut marshmallows in half width-wise.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Put a dab of yellow frosting on the cut side of each marshmallow half and place frosting side down on upper half of graham cracker to form base for eyes.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Put a small stripe of frosting on piece of candy corn and secure to graham cracker between and below marshmallows to form beak.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>On top of marshmallows, make a small circle of frosting and place a mini chocolate chip in the center of frosting to finish forming the eyes. </li>&#13;\n\
    </ol><h2>Mar-gore-itas with Lime Wheel Eyeball</h2><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><i>The fun part about these drinks is the decorated glassware. So you can use the enhanced margarita glasses, filled with ginger ale or another age-appropriate beverage, for the younger set as well. This recipe comes from entertaining guru and regular <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ftoday.msnbc.msn.com%2f\">Today Show</a> contributor <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.jeannebenedict.com%2frecipes%2fmar-gore-ita-with-lime-wheel-eyeball-from-jeanne-benedicts-halloween-cocktail-today-show-appearance%2f\">Jeanne Benedict</a> (who also happens to be a high school friend of mine!).</i></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>Ingredients/Directions for Margaritas:</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ul><li>1 1/2 oz. Tequila </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>1/2 oz. triple sec </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>2 oz. sweet and sour mix</li>&#13;\n\
    </ul><p>Combine ingredients over ice in prepared red caramel blood-dripped Margarita glass with lime eye-ball garnish.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>Ingredients for Lime Wheel Eyeball:</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ul><li>Lime wheel (slice of lime)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Red Maraschino cherry </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Mini chocolate chip </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>1-inch long piece of green plastic straw</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Red Caramel (see recipe below) </li>&#13;\n\
    </ul><p><b>Directions:</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ol><li>The day before the party, cut maraschino cherries in half and prep red caramel</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Use a dab of red caramel on back of mini chocolate chips and stick them in center of cherries to resemble a pupil. </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Dip ends of 1-inch straws in red caramel and insert into the open cut side of each Maraschino cherry half. (The cherry will look like a little umbrella with the straw as a handle. This will help keep the cherry in place on the lime as wet cherries do not stick to wet limes very well!) </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Set cherries on a piece of wax paper, and allow caramel to set up overnight.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>An hour before the party, cut a slit into the lime wheel and slip the straw with cherry on it into the slit and up to the center of the lime wheel as the iris of the eyeball. </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Slip the garnishes on the rims of the glasses. </li>&#13;\n\
    </ol><p><b>Red Caramel Blood Drips</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>Ingredients:</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ul><li>1 cup granulated sugar </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>1/2 cup light corn syrup </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>1/4 cup hot water </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>1/4 teaspoon red food coloring</li>&#13;\n\
    </ul><p><b>Directions:</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ol><li>To make the red caramel drips: Combine ingredients in a small saucepan and stir until sugar is moistened. </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Heat saucepan over medium-high heat until mixture reaches soft ball candy stage, about 4 to 6 minutes. </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Remove from heat and cool completely. </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Place Margarita glasses on wax paper. </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Use the back of a spoon to scrape red caramel on the outside glass rims creating the blood drips. </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Allow caramel to set up overnight. </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Clean drips off bottom or base of glasses if necessary where caramel has dripped down.</li>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>"If we're going to have sustained winds of 70 mph, it's not safe for our students who are walking, driving or being on a bus," Poe said.

    \t\t\t<p><span><em><strong>Covington and Tipp have had their share of early-round post-season frustrations, but a look around the state tells us that they have plenty of company.\xC2\xA0 The issue is&#8230;why?</strong></em></span></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Yogi (Berra) would say,</strong> &#8220;It&#8217;s like deja-vu all over again.&#8221;</p>\n\
    <p>In motion picture terms, it&#8217;s like a scene with Bill Murray from <em><strong>Groundhog Day</strong></em>.</p>\n\
    <p>A psychic might shake her head over it and say, &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to go there this weekend.&#8221;</p>\n\
    <p>What are we talking about?</p>\n\
    <p>The football playoffs open this weekend with as many as eleven area teams within twenty miles of Miami County (Covington, Bradford, Tippecanoe, Milton Union, Miami East, Minster, Ft. Loramie, Marion Local, Wayne, Trotwood and Tecumseh) awarded first-round games, hoping to advance toward that elusive date for the state finals in Massillon and Canton on the first weekend in December.</p>\n\
    <p>And while that opportunity seems wide open and positive three days out, the reality for some teams must seem like winning once you get there, in Biblical terms, is like putting a camel through the eye of a needle (Matt. 19:24).</p>\n\
    <p>The two most notables in that respect from Miami County would be Covington and Tippecanoe.</p>\n\
    <p>Since 1999 no Division VI \xC2\xA0team in southwest Ohio (or statewide) has a regular season winning percentage as high, or higher, than the Covington Buccaneers.\xC2\xA0 During that twenty three year period the Buccs have had perfect 10-0 seasons eight times, amassing an overall winning percentage of 85.8% (133-24).</p>\n\
    <p>Their post-season record, however, has been a different story.\xC2\xA0 In 23 games (Division V and VI) the Buccs are just 10-13. Five of those losses came in the first round to MAC opponents, Delphos St. John, Marion Local (twice), and Coldwater.\xC2\xA0 Another loss in 2007 came at the hands of the Lehman Cavaliers.</p>\n\
    <div id=\"attachment_19066\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpressprosmagazine.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2fhistorytellsus_inset2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-19066\" title=\"historytellsus_inset2\" src=\"http://pressprosmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/historytellsus_inset2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"367\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Coach Bret Pearce and the Milton Union Bulldogs return to the playoffs this weekend, but have never advanced beyond the regional round previously.</p></div>\n\
    <p>Likewise, few teams can rival the regular season consistency of the Tipp Red Devils during the past decade.\xC2\xA0 Not as good as Covington in terms of winning percentage, perhaps, but Charlie Burgbacher&#8217;s teams have nonetheless won better than 75% of their games against league opponents.\xC2\xA0 However, their post-season percentage for the same period, like Covington&#8217;s, is far short of that, having been\xC2\xA0knocked out consistently in the first round by teams like St. Marys, Clyde, and Turpin, who the Red Devils play this weekend as the #8 seed in the first round.</p>\n\
    <p>By the way, neither Covington and Tipp are alone with this ignominy.\xC2\xA0 Many teams from around the state can claim to be regular season goliaths, only to come up short against &#8220;more select&#8221; competition.\xC2\xA0 In Lawrence County, along the Ohio River, Division VI Symmes Valley and Coach Rusty Webb have been exemplary since 2000, but have never advanced to the regional round of the tournament.</p>\n\
    <p>Now\xC2\xA0we use quotation marks to emphasize the term &#8220;more select&#8221; for a reason.\xC2\xA0 For competition is what history tells us about the playoffs, painting a picture for teams like Covington.\xC2\xA0 For their\xC2\xA0sterling and deserved reputation as being the best in their league and one of the best small-school programs in the state,\xC2\xA0the Buccs have never been to Massillon, but did finish as runners-up to Mogadore High School in the 1979 championship game (then Class A) played in Akron&#8230;33 years ago.</p>\n\
    <p>It is important to note, too, that up until last year Covington&#8217;s classification was that of a Division VI school, playing in the smallest of the state&#8217;s six divisions.\xC2\xA0 Small schools mean, in most cases, a struggle to maintain as many as 30 boys in their football program, thereby often playing at a competitive disadvantage.\xC2\xA0 This has really hurt Covington in the past when paired against Division VI programs like Marion Local and Delphos, who regularly dress 75 and enjoy far better depth at every position on the field.</p>\n\
    <p>For that fact Covington simply does not see that kind of depth, or competition, in their affiliation as a member of the Cross County Conference.\xC2\xA0 Rarely does an opponent in that league dress 40, Miami East being the notable exception.\xC2\xA0 Covington dressed 42 this year when fully healthy.\xC2\xA0 The league average in the CCC is 34.</p>\n\
    <p>Likewise, Tipp has suffered from a competitive shortfall in the Central Buckeye Conference in recent years, but not from numbers.\xC2\xA0 Past perennial powers such as Bellefontaine, Graham and Urbana have fallen on leaner football fortunes, leaving only Springfield Shawnee and Tecumseh as competitive equals to the Red Devils, and both beat Tipp this year in head-to-head matchups during the season.</p>\n\
    <p>Now it doesn&#8217;t take a genius to figure out that better competition prepares you to be competitive against &#8220;select&#8221; competition, the kind you see beginning this weekend in the first round of the playoffs.\xC2\xA0 And it&#8217;s long been the contention within Covington, as well as outside, that to be better prepared you have to play better people on a consistent basis. \xC2\xA0 It&#8217;s\xC2\xA0 advantage enjoyed for several years now by those members of the Midwest Athletic Conference, Versailles, St. John, Coldwater, Marion and St. Henry, who have won 21 state titles between them.\xC2\xA0 And while Covington has been competitive on some occasions against the likes of Marion and Lehman, they&#8217;ve never beaten a MAC team in the playoffs.</p>\n\
    <p>Likewise, Tipp will see a team this weekend (Turpin) whose 10-0 record came as a member of the East Cincinnati Conference, featuring past state champion Anderson High School, who won the Division II title in 2007.\xC2\xA0 And Tipp was more than competitive against that same Turpin team last year, losing in the first round to the Spartans, 24-21.</p>\n\
    <p>The problem therefore becomes, how do you improve the relative competition that would better prepare you for the playoffs when you&#8217;re a member of a weak, or weaker, football conference?</p>\n\
    <p>That issue has been written about here on Press Pros, ad nauseum, and in truth dismissed by administrators and athletic directors about the Cross County Conference as being more trouble to address than its worth.\xC2\xA0 Most take the attitude that they&#8217;re helpless to change because a migration of the better programs to a more competitive league affiliation would leave the weaker schools with a myriad of other scheduling and affiliation issues.</p>\n\
    <p>But in fact\xC2\xA0better competition has irrefutably determined the\xC2\xA0history of area teams pertaining to their fortunes in the post-season.\xC2\xA0 Piqua and Trotwood, the only members of the Greater Western Ohio Conference to have won a state title in 2006 and &#8217;11, respectively, both honed for the challenge by playing the likes of the top Division I and II competition in the state.</p>\n\
    <div id=\"attachment_19065\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpressprosmagazine.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2fhistorytellsus_inset.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-19065\" title=\"historytellsus_inset\" src=\"http://pressprosmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/historytellsus_inset.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"404\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dave Miller (above) and Covington host Dixie in this weekend&#8217;s first round, the first meeting between the two programs since 1963.</p></div>\n\
    <p>Likewise, Versailles, Marion, St. Henry, Delphos, Minster\xC2\xA0and Coldwater, winners of all those titles, \xC2\xA0walk the gauntlet every week, playing each other with more than just league pride on the line.</p>\n\
    <p>&#8220;Surviving our league is generally tougher than most teams we see in the post-season,&#8221;\xC2\xA0 says Marion&#8217;s Tim Goodwin, who has six times advanced to the state\xC2\xA0championship game\xC2\xA0in his twelve seasons as head coach, winning five.\xC2\xA0 &#8220;At least until you get to the semi-final or final game.\xC2\xA0 By the time we get to the end of season we&#8217;re prepared to play anybody.&#8221;</p>\n\
    <p>8-2 this season, Marion is more than prepared as they face Bradford this weekend, the Railroaders making their first playoff appearance in 28 years.</p>\n\
    <p>For the record, Covington meets Dixie (7-3) on Saturday night, and history-wise the Buccs will have a decided advantage on the Greyhounds, a member of the Southwest Buckeye League who are making their first-ever playoff appearance.\xC2\xA0 The two teams have played five times previously, but not since 1963, and Covington has won the five previous meetings.</p>\n\
    <p>But in terms of their current competitive attributes, the Greyhounds own wins this year over past state champion Valley View, and a 28-27 win three weeks ago over Division IV Milton Union.</p>\n\
    <p>Yes, it&#8217;s playoff football, and if history tells us anything it&#8217;s simply this. \xC2\xA0 It certainly matters who you play when you get there.\xC2\xA0 But it&#8217;s usually<strong> who you&#8217;ve &#8220;played&#8221;</strong> to get there&#8230;that determines how far you go.</p>\n\
    <p>Over and over again!</p>\n\

  summary: Resumes' Really Matter...While at least eleven area teams will play this weekend in round one of the post-season football playoffs, including Charlie Burgbacher (left) and Tipp City, the reality is that only a few have seen anyone as good previously as the competition they're about to face.

    <p>Hurricane Sandy has washed out another day of school in Concord, and town officials will wait until morning to make a determination about whether to open town offices, officials said Monday night.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>After the powerful storm downed trees, closed roads and left much of the region without power for extended stretches on Monday, Oct. 29 -- the one year anniversary of last year's freak October snow storm -- a lost Monday will turn into a lost Tuesday for many.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>During the height of the storm, Concord fared better than most as far as power outages are concerned. However, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2farticles%2fconcord-s-hurricane-sandy-response-so-far\">emergency responders were busy clearing downed limbs and trees</a> on town roads and Route 2.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>After a day of wild weather Diana Rigby, the superintendent of schools, confirmed Monday night that school would be canceled again on Tuesday, Oct. 30.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>However, Town Manager Chris Whelan, said he plans to speak with Fire Chief Mark Cotreau and and CMLP Director Dave Wood at 6 a.m. Tuesday morning and will  decide then about opening Town offices.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"The primary problem now is power  outages and downed power lines raising safety concerns,\" Whelan said, adding a decision to close would be posted to the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcordma.gov\">town website</a>.</p>\n\

    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CThe town\xE2\x80\x99s been out in just a constant effort to follow up on these wires and trees to keep the roads clear,\" Fire Chief Mark Cotreau said Monday afternoon.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The town's Department of Public Works has two loaders out that have been responding to push heavy trees out of the way so responders can maintain access along the town's roadways.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Meanwhile, Concord's Municipal Light Department has been dealing with power outages. A total of 600 customers lost power this morning, and that service restored, according to Cotreau, who said some minor outages may persist this afternoon and into the evening.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Since this morning, the Fire Department\xC2\xA0 has been on 14 calls for a variety of different reasons, Cotreau said, adding there have been no accidents, injuries or structures directly affected by falling trees or other storm damage.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>After a day where thousands of New Englanders have lost power, roads and buildings have been flooded and winds-and-rain have lashed everyone, we're just on the verge of the worst of it.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Forecasters have been warning that Monday evening would be New England's moment of most severe intensity for Sandy. That prediction seems to be right on-target.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>\"Like a large nor'easter on steroids\"</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>According to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.accuweather.com%2f\">Accuweather</a> forecasters, Hurricane Sandy is poised for a New Jersey landfall any moment now.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Those same Accuweather forecasters are calling Sandy a \"Northeast catastrophe unfolding.\"\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Conditions will deteriorate through the day Monday with the worst of the storm spreading inland Monday night into Tuesday,\" says Accuweather.</p><p>That means the driving rain and whipping winds will be felt hundreds of miles inland, not just right on the coast.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>O, yes, and today's full moon will add to high-tide levels for coastal folks.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>While Accuweather is forecasting gusts up to 80 mph in the New Jersey area, the usually much calmer <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.weather.gov%2f\">weather.gov</a> is forecasting a slightly less blowy 60 mph for southern New England. But even it is saying damaging winds are expected in our area through Monday evening.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Some other forecasters are even a little more chill: <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2fnews%2fweather%2fweather_wisdom%2f2012%2f10%2fmain_part_of_storm_will_be_fel.html\">meterologist David Epstein on boston.com</a>\xC2\xA0says right now is the most intense; Sandy will lessen in intensity from here on our.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>So whether to choose to go with the more hyperbolic forecasts or the calmer ones, there is full agreement: Sandy is coming ashore in New Jersey now, and this evening will be New England's moments of greatest wind-and-rain intensity.</p>\n\

    <p>As <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpatchogue.patch.com%2farticles%2fpower-outages-piling-up-in-pat-med">power outages pile up</a>, some families may only have their cell phone available for accessing information. Should this happen, here are a number of phone settings to change in order to prolong your battery for as long as possible.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Turn Off Unnecessary Connections</strong></p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>For those with iPhones, Android or other smartphones, you can extend the battery by turning off WiFi, 4G and/or 3G connections if available, or even putting your phone into airplane mode and only taking it off when you want to use the phone. All of these connections use battery up whether using it or not.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Close All Background Applications</strong></p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Smartphones have apps, and sometimes they are running even when you do not want them to. If using an iPhone, double tap the home button to bring up a list of open applications at the bottom of your screen. Press and hold one of the icons, and then tap the red circle with the white horzontal line in it to deactivate each of them. If using an Android device, enter the device settings, and select "Manage Applications." There you can see which apps are running. Select the app you want to stop, and select the "Force Stop" option.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Lower Brightness Levels</strong></p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>In your phone's settings menu, reduce the brightness of the screen to the lowest acceptable level.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Keep Use To A Minimum</strong></p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>This may be a given, but other than necessary information try to keep phone use to a minimum. Especially for those with phones loaded with movies, music and other games. Try to stick to necessary calls, texts and checking news information like <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2farticles%2fhurricane-sandy-concord-info-center">on Patch</a>.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><em>Stay safe, and Concord Patch will continue to update with storm information.</em></p>

                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>HAMPTON, N.H. (AP) &mdash; A massive storm with winds topping 70 mph on Monday left more than 120,000 homes and businesses in the dark and swept away plans by the presidential campaigns to hold events in the state.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>A man was critically injured Monday evening in Windham by a falling tree as the state was being pounded by powerful gusts, said Katya Brennan, a spokeswoman for the state Emergency Operation Center. Windham police were unable to provide details.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The National Weather Service reported gusts of 60 mph in Portsmouth, 62 mph in Londonderry and 76 mph at the Isle of Shoals, just off the coast. Forecasters said rainfall could reach up to 4 inches.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Gov. John Lynch declared a state of emergency, urging motorists to stay off roads and sending nonessential state workers home at 3 p.m.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Water in the roadways, flying debris and downed power lines are all possible because of the severity of this storm, which is why we are urging people to stay off the roads unless absolutely necessary,&rsquo;&rsquo; Lynch said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Superstorm Sandy, no longer a hurricane, remained dangerous after slamming ashore in New Jersey and combining with two other weather systems.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Lynch encouraged people to stay away from the dangerous surf, but some were drawn to the ocean&rsquo;s fury. Dimitri Garbuzov was supposed to be working from home in Dover but was lured to Hampton Beach by the images he saw on a surf cam.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I just got into surfing recently, and I knew the waves were going to be impressive,&rsquo;&rsquo; the 30-year-old said. &lsquo;&lsquo;Plus, I've never seen what the ocean looks like in a storm.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Though the beach was closed, dozens of onlookers gathered on the sidewalks, some cheering as if they were on an amusement park ride each time a wave crashed over the seawall.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Goffstown&rsquo;s resident Elaine St. Pierre said she initially thought her husband was crazy to suggest driving to Hampton but called it &lsquo;&lsquo;a once-in-a-lifetime thing.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I'm glad we came, but I'll be glad to get home,&rsquo;&rsquo; St. Pierre, 69, said as she got sprayed by the water.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Some marshy areas and roads near the beach were flooded. In nearby Portsmouth, the library, City Hall and other buildings closed at 4 p.m. and Halloween trick-or-treating, originally planned for Tuesday, was postponed until Saturday. The ports of Portsmouth and Portland, Maine, took the unusual steps of closing to commercial traffic at 5 p.m., the Coast Guard said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Politicians surrendered to the storm. Democratic Vice President Joe Biden canceled a rally planned for Monday in Keene, and Republican Mitt Romney&rsquo;s wife, Ann Romney, called off her bus tour through the state. Both campaigns urged supporters to donate money, goods or supplies for the relief effort for Sandy victims.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Romney campaign volunteer Cheryl Poussard, of Hampstead, was looking forward to seeing Ann Romney. Instead, she stayed at the campaign&rsquo;s office in Derry and helped make phone calls.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Mitt Romney had planned to hold a rally in Milford on Tuesday night, but that also was canceled, as was first lady Michelle Obama&rsquo;s appearance at the University of New Hampshire.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In Concord, cooking supply shop owner Mike Beauregard said President Barack Obama&rsquo;s decision to cancel his campaign plans elsewhere Monday to focus on his official duties shouldn&rsquo;t be viewed as a political move.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;The last thing first responders need is for these folks to be running around,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Beauregard, an independent who leans Republican but declined to say for whom he&rsquo;s voting.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Numerous schools across the state were closed, and flights were canceled at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport. At least 13 shelters opened.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Earlier, Lynch put 100 New Hampshire Guard soldiers on active duty to conduct wellness checks, assist with debris removal and distribute food and water. Utilities secured crews from Canada and a number of states as they prepared for tree damage to equipment and prolonged power outages.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Public Service of New Hampshire, the largest utility in the state, requested an additional 550 line crews in addition to its own. Crews were arriving from Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. PSNH also staged 100 tree-trimming crews around the state and requested more.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">

    <p>After a day where thousands of New Englanders have lost power, roads and buildings have been flooded and winds-and-rain have lashed everyone, we're just on the verge of the worst of it.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Forecasters have been warning that Monday evening would be New England's moment of most severe intensity for Sandy. That prediction seems to be right on-target.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>\"Like a large nor'easter on steroids\"</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>According to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.accuweather.com%2f\">Accuweather</a> forecasters, Hurricane Sandy is poised for a New Jersey landfall any moment now.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Those same Accuweather forecasters are calling Sandy a \"Northeast catastrophe unfolding.\"\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Conditions will deteriorate through the day Monday with the worst of the storm spreading inland Monday night into Tuesday,\" says Accuweather.</p><p>That means the driving rain and whipping winds will be felt hundreds of miles inland, not just right on the coast.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>O, yes, and today's full moon will add to high-tide levels for coastal folks.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>While Accuweather is forecasting gusts up to 80 mph in the New Jersey area, the usually much calmer <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.weather.gov%2f\">weather.gov</a> is forecasting a slightly less blowy 60 mph for southern New England. But even it is saying damaging winds are expected in our area through Monday evening.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Some other forecasters are even a little more chill: <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2fnews%2fweather%2fweather_wisdom%2f2012%2f10%2fmain_part_of_storm_will_be_fel.html\">meterologist David Epstein on boston.com</a>\xC2\xA0says right now is the most intense; Sandy will lessen in intensity from here on our.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>So whether to choose to go with the more hyperbolic forecasts or the calmer ones, there is full agreement: Sandy is coming ashore in New Jersey now, and this evening will be New England's moments of greatest wind-and-rain intensity.</p>\n\

    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; Across New Hampshire Wednesday shelters closed, schools reopened and utility crews continued to restore power to homes and businesses in the aftermath of Sandy.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>By 7:30 p.m., the number of homes and businesses without power was down to about 33,000 from a peak of 210,000. All customers are expected to have power back on by Friday.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The storm that started in earnest in the state on Monday didn&rsquo;t leave quietly, however. National Weather Service meteorologist Eric Sinsabaugh said a &lsquo;&lsquo;microburst&rsquo;&rsquo; of heavy rain and gusty wind hit Franklin just before 10 p.m. Tuesday, toppling large pines onto some cottages around Webster Lake. One unoccupied cottage was destroyed while others were damaged.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;We've had a lot worse,&rsquo;&rsquo; Franklin Fire Capt. Gary Hicks said, noting there were no reported injuries. &lsquo;&lsquo;But the people who suffered damage are not going to agree.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Sandy, which started as a hurricane before combining with two wintry weather systems to create a deadly superstorm, killed one New Hampshire resident, identified Wednesday as 42-year-old Eugene &lsquo;&lsquo;Rusty&rsquo;&rsquo; Brooks.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Brooks, a Woodstock construction company owner, had gone to check on a house foundation under construction in Lincoln. He was standing between a dirt cellar hole full of water and a pile of rocks that had been cleared during excavation when he was buried in a landslide of mud, water and rock.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;It was like standing on a dam that gave way,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Lincoln Police Chief Theodore Smith said. &lsquo;&lsquo;It basically was a really freak accident.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Smith, who had coffee with Brooks just before the accident, said many people in the area knew him and are devastated by his death.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>A Windham man was seriously injured when a tree fell on a car in which he was a passenger Monday afternoon. Three other people in the car were not hurt. William DeLuca III, 56, was taken to a Boston hospital and New Hampshire authorities did not know his condition.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>New Hampshire escaped the widespread destruction the storm brought to New York City and New Jersey. But Sandy meant that for the second year in a row, some communities postponed trick-or-treating. Last year, it was a surprise October snowstorm that put a damper on Halloween plans.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Cheryl Hass of Londonderry says her daughters &mdash; ages 8 and 10 &mdash; went from being thrilled Tuesday that trick-or-treating would still be on for Halloween night to being disappointed it&rsquo;s now postponed until Sunday.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Once you explain why they understand, but they&rsquo;re still disappointed,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;&lsquo;If people don&rsquo;t have power, it would be weird to trick-or-treat if you think about it.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>During the storm Monday, according to the National Weather Service, Goshen had the highest recorded winds of any community at 70 mph, though winds at the summit of Mount Washington were twice that. Randolph had the most rain, just over 6 inches.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="">
    <p>President Barack Obama on Tuesday granted Gov. John Lynch&rsquo;s request to issue an emergency disaster declaration for all 10 counties. That makes federal aid available to communities affected by the storm.<img alt="end of story marker" border="0" height="8" width="6" src="http://www.boston.com/r/SysConfig/WebPortal/Boston/Framework/images/site_graphics/dingbat_story_end_icon.gif" class="storyend"></p>

It traces how America&#8217;s move to independence was reported at the time in American and English newspapers. Every section shows some actual eighteenth-century news reports alongside a historian&#8217;s analysis of the event. </p><p>I wrote two sections. The first is on the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fPowder%2520Alarm">&#8220;Powder Alarm&#8221;</a> of September 1774, which signaled the <i>de facto</i> end of royal rule in most of New England; that doesn&#8217;t get a lot of space in most histories of the war because, well, nobody died. But it was a big deal for newspapers. Whig <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fprinters">printers</a> presented the notes of the mass gathering on <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fCambridge">Cambridge</a> common as if it were a formal meeting, and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fWilliam%2520Brattle">William Brattle</a> published a public letter trying to deny what he&#8217;d been caught saying in private&#8212;not that it did him any good.</p><p>My second essay is on the Battle of <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fLexington">Lexington</a> and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fConcord">Concord</a> eight months later. For that I took the approach of tracing how news of the event spread, starting with the first oral reports of <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fBritish%2520soldiers">British army officers</a> riding out of Boston. As with any fight, it took a while for the authorities and the press to sort out rumors, false claims, and facts. Newspapers in both America and Britain show how the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fMassachusetts%2520Provincial%2520Congress">Massachusetts Provincial Congress</a> did a much better job than Gen. <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fThomas%2520Gage">Thomas Gage</a> in spreading its version of events.

    </p><ul><li><strong>Remove yard items: </strong>Take in Halloween decorations, political signs, tables and chairs, barrels, trash cans and anything else that can get swept up by the wind and become dangerous.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>Power up: </strong>Recharge everything, including laptops and cell phones.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>Have flashlights at the ready: </strong>Track down the flashlights throughout your home and make sure you have them in a place that you\xE2\x80\x99ll find if you lose power.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>Check your battery supply: </strong>Check to make sure you have enough flashlight batteries to get you through the storm and aftermath. Some officials have warned that we may see power outages that last for days in some areas.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>Clear out nearby storm drains: </strong>We could get more than two inches of rain from the storm, which could cause flooding problems. Clear away any leaves that may be blocking stormdrains near your house.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>Check your sump pump: </strong>For homes with basement sump pumps, you should check to make sure they are working properly.</li>&#13;\n\

    <p>There are a lot of things I do for exercise: bike, power walk, lift weights, even, occasionally, run, but only when forced to by my daughter. However, I\xE2\x80\x99ve never been able to convince myself to add swimming into my regimen. I think a big part of it is the cold \xE2\x80\x93 that water better be pretty darn warm for me to be willing to get into it. Plus there\xE2\x80\x99s the whole hair thing: It gets wet, and you have to dry it and style it and fuss with it. Yes, I have many excuses for staying out of the pool.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Not so for many others, as a day at <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.concordnet.org%2fpages%2fconcordma_recreation%2fbsfc\">Beede Center</a> will attest. The center's pools are full of lap swimmers and water aerobics doers and toddlers with parents in tow. And, as I recently learned, a girl training for the Olympics.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Yep. Right here in our local pool. Pretty cool, eh??</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>That girl is Gracia Leydon-Mahoney of Newton, and she trains here in Concord because this is where her coach, Tracey Bird, is. Tracey is an impressive swimmer in her own right: She was a champion diver for Stanford University when she was in college, and coached there for several years after. She moved to Concord in 1996 with her husband and two sons, has dabbled at Heritage and coached at <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2flistings%2fconcord-carlisle-regional-high-school\">CCHS</a> in the past.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Gracia\xE2\x80\x99s mom found Bird through a mutual friend; she had heard about her diving and coaching experience, knocked on her door, and asked her to take on Gracia. She did, and in just five years has coached Gracia into a diver on track to be an Olympian.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Last June, Gracia dove in the Olympic trials, where she placed seventh on the three-meter springboard and 10th on the platform dive. Then, just a few weeks ago, she was in Adelaide, Australia, where she won the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.fina.org%2fH2O%2findex.php%3foption%3dcom_content%26amp%3bview%3dcategory%26amp%3blayout%3dblog%26amp%3bid%3d116%26amp%3bItemid%3d747\">Junior World Championships</a>. Bird told me that this event is like the Olympics in the sense that all the top divers are there. Gracia beat the Chinese diver who was ahead of her by 20 points, and the third place diver was a woman from Great Britain who went to the Olympics.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Since Gracia is just 16-years-old. It would seem she\xE2\x80\x99s on the fast track to more championship diving; she\xE2\x80\x99s now moved to Durham, North Carolina, where there is a 10-meter board for her to train on for the Olympic trials. Even so, Bird is staying in touch with her training by communicating with the coach there.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>But Bird is keeping her toe in the pool, so to speak, heading to Stanford to help coach the college team there, just for the season. Then she\xE2\x80\x99ll be back swimming at the Beede, keeping an eye out, no doubt, for other Olympic hopefuls.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>&#13;\n\

    The storm continues to be historic and once it makes land fall later today will transition from a pure tropical system to a non-tropical one.  That fact is simply semantics and for meteorologists to ponder as the effects will be the same. The big aspect to this storm for most people continues to be the wind.  Those people who live and have businesses on or very close to the water will have storm surge as well.  Winds will increase into early afternoon with the strongest gusts from about 2pm to 7pm. <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2fnews%2fweather%2fweather_wisdom%2fwinds%2520monday%2520am.gif"><img alt="winds monday am.gif" src="http://www.boston.com/news/weather/weather_wisdom/assets_c/2012/10/winds monday am-thumb-300x240-86467.gif" width="300" height="240" class="mt-image-left"></a>  It will still be very windy thereafter, but ever so slowly becoming less intense.  High tide is around noon and midnight and for those of you on the coast, the water may not retreat very much between tides today. <em>I am updating on this storm and of course future ones on Twitter at <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ftwitter.com%2fgrowingwisdom">@growingwisdom</a> please follow me there and ask any questions.</em>  This is becoming a nowcasting storm. Nowcasting is really looking at the information hour by hour and then making any changes to the forecast as needed. <br>
    </p></div>
    		<div class="articlePluckHidden"><p><strong>Today</strong><br>
    I think everyone has seen the projected track of the storm by now, but here it is again. From this point forward our weather deteriorates until about midnight tonight when things will ever so slowly begin the trend back from the intensity of the storm. <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2fnews%2fweather%2fweather_wisdom%2ftrack%2520monday%2520am.gif"><img alt="track monday am.gif" src="http://www.boston.com/news/weather/weather_wisdom/assets_c/2012/10/track monday am-thumb-300x240-86469.gif" width="300" height="240" class="mt-image-left"></a> The TV media will be in overdrive today and into tomorrow and I recommend  taking a break from the coverage from time to time.   News outlets are great for getting you information you need, but also they are a business and they want you to watch their coverage of the storm.  Those waves crashing over that seawall aren't going to go into most of our homes and the tree that falls on a house  will be the exception, not the rule.  Unfortunately there is going to be significant damage from Atlantic City through southern New England  to some infrastructure like boardwalks, subways and oceanfront homes, but most of you will just have to endure one, two or several days without power, a flooded basement or perhaps some damage to the yard.  I think it's important to keep in mind that of the 60 million people affected by the storm,  a relatively small number will have their lives impacted beyond a few days.  One caveat to that will be those commuters in New York.  If some of the subways flood, which is a possibility, that would end up creating a commuter's nightmare for quite a long time.  We won't know until late Monday if that is going to happen.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Wind</strong><br>
    <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2fnews%2fweather%2fweather_wisdom%2fwinds%2520predicted%2520Monday.png"><img alt="winds predicted Monday.png" src="http://www.boston.com/news/weather/weather_wisdom/assets_c/2012/10/winds predicted Monday-thumb-600x296-86455.png" width="600" height="296" class="mt-image-none"></a><br>
    The wind continues to be what I believe most of you will remember from this storm.  Often with storms the winds howls for a few hours and then it's done.  With this storm, the wind is going to be strong all day today.  I expect the winds to peak this afternoon and subside Tuesday.   The closer you are to the coast and the center of Sandy the earlier this afternoon the winds really begin to howl.  In the local Boston area by late morning we will start to see gusts over 50 miles per hour and power outages will begin becoming common. The long duration of the wind can cause trees to give, become uprooted and fall.  Some trees may also have cracks in them from past storms that have not healed.  This means the trees are weaker to start.   I have had two white pines come down over the past couple of years and barely miss the house.   That is one of my biggest concerns from this storm.   The further inland you are the less powerful the wind will be.  However, if you live on an exposed hill the winds can be gustier.  Those of you closest to the coast will have, on average, the highest winds.  Gusts of wind are going to be what takes down the power.  You will notice the wind range go from 20 miles per hour to as high as 50 miles per hour in just seconds.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Power loss</strong><br>
    If you don't lose power consider yourself fortunate.  I am planning on losing power and I made some food that we can eat when the power does go out.   Have your flashlight ready by the night stand and talk to the kids about what to do if they have to get up tonight without power.  Most of us still have power, but as the day goes on the number of outages will increase.  How long it takes to come back is anyone's guess, let's hope the power companies have a good plan for this, they certainly knew it was coming.</p><p><strong>Rainfall</strong><br>
    Rainfall doesn't look too bad for New England.  Those of you in the mid-Atlantic region will have much more rain and therefore flood issue.<a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2fnews%2fweather%2fweather_wisdom%2fRainfall%2520sunday%2520night.gif"><img alt="Rainfall sunday night.gif" src="http://www.boston.com/news/weather/weather_wisdom/assets_c/2012/10/Rainfall sunday night-thumb-300x239-86459.gif" width="300" height="239" class="mt-image-left"></a>  There is a flood watch up for parts of New England, but I am not overly concerned about flooding.   Check the basement from time to time just to be safe and be sure that drains near your house are not clogged.  </p>
    
    <p><strong>Storm surge</strong><br>
    The storm surge kills more people and does more damage than the wind.  From New Jersey to New York City all across Long Island and up the southern New England coastline the storm surge will cause damage.  The exact amount of damage is highly dependent on the particular spot along the coastline.   Little inlets where the water funnels can see much more damage than an open flat beach.  If the worst of the storm occurs at high tide that is much more damaging than at low tide. <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2fnews%2fweather%2fweather_wisdom%2fflooding%2520sunday%2520night.png"><img alt="flooding sunday night.png" src="http://www.boston.com/news/weather/weather_wisdom/assets_c/2012/10/flooding sunday night-thumb-300x180-86457.png" width="300" height="180" class="mt-image-left"></a> The reason is that at low tide, the surge has to get to the high tide point, then to flood levels.  If you start the surge at high tide, you have that much less room before things start flooding.   Monday and Tuesday are astronomically high tides as well.  This means that even without the storm, the tides on those days would be a bit higher than average.<br>
    <strong>Some tips</strong><br>
    Keep the fridge and freezer closed as much as possible if the power fails.  You can put things in a cooler you might need frequently like milk and juice.  They will keep for a while in the cooler.  If you have a grill, don't forget that once the winds calm down you can cook that way.  If you have power you can make a block of ice putting water in a freezer bag.  A solid block of ice keeps things cold for a long time.  That is why they use to call them "ice chests" after all.  Generators must be vented outside, you can kill you and your family in minutes running them inside.  Same tip goes for the car in the garage if you are charging your cell phone leave the door open while the car is running.   <br>
    <strong>After the storm</strong><br>
    When this is over there will be those who went to work, who had no damage and who didn't lose power.   For them, they might say "that wasn't so bad".  Others will have their lives turned upside down and still some may lose their lives.  The nature of these storms is that they don't hit all of us the same, but are all going to go through it.   I hope the blog has helped you prepare for the storm and will help you during it as well.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Tuesday-Friday</strong><br>
    Winds will subside on tomorrow and there will be a few leftover showers.  Since the storm will basically sit and spin itself to death over northern Maine I am not expecting rapid clearing.  We will see clouds and a few showers much of the week.  The sun will come out from time to time Thursday and Friday but we have to wait until the weekend for a truly sunny day.  Temperatures will be cool but not cold throughout the rest of the week.  A peak into next week shows that we may see a touch of mild weather.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Gardening this week</strong><br>
    There are many plants that bloom in the fall.  Toad lily, asters, mums, joe pye weed, roses and many others wait or continue blooming into late fall.  It's a good idea to have a garden with plants that bloom in all different season.  When I design my gardens I select plants that bloom from February to November here in the northeast.  Additionally, but adding some special evergreens, I can bring color to the garden all year long.<br>

  content: "<div><div><p><i>Energizer</i>\xC2\xA0and International Association of Fire Chiefs Honor Silver Anniversary with Adoption of 25 Fire Departments and Donation of 250,000 Batteries across the Country</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The message is simple, and the habit can be lifesaving. Thirty-eight percent of fatal fire injuries occur in homes without working smoke alarms, while 24 percent occur in homes in which at least one smoke alarm is present but fails to operate, frequently due to dead or missing batteries.* For 25 years, the\xC2\xA0<i>Change Your Clock Change Your Battery</i><sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>program has been dedicated to helping share the life-saving reminder to change the batteries in your home\xE2\x80\x99s smoke and carbon monoxide detectors when you change your clocks for daylight savings.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>This year,\xC2\xA0<i>Energizer</i>\xC2\xA0and the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC) will mark the silver anniversary of one of the nation\xE2\x80\x99s top home fire safety programs by donating 250,000<i>Energizer<sub>\xC2\xAE</sub></i>\xC2\xA0MAX<sub>\xC2\xAE\xC2\xA0</sub>batteries to fire departments across the country to distribute to local families in their areas and adopting 25 fire departments in 25 cities across the nation, who, in addition to batteries, will be equipped with a variety<i>Energizer</i><sub>\xC2\xAE</sub>\xC2\xA0family safety products for their department and to share in their communities. Together, they will host Home Safety Days and neighborhood canvasses spanning throughout National Fire Prevention Month in October until the end of daylight saving time on Sunday, Nov. 4.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CIn the past 25 years, the number of home fire deaths has substantially decreased,\xE2\x80\x9D said Chief Hank Clemmensen, IAFC president and chairman of the board. \xE2\x80\x9CThat success is mostly thanks to the thousands of hours\xE2\x80\x94every year for 25 years\xE2\x80\x94that local fire departments have dedicated to improving the safety environment through technology, policy and, especially, public education efforts like the\xC2\xA0<i>Change Your Clock Change Your Battery<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>\xC2\xA0</i>program. But the world does not stand still, local fire department budgets are shrinking, many people still don\xE2\x80\x99t have a basic baseline of protection from smoke alarms, and we must keep pace with changes in technology and the built environment, It\xE2\x80\x99s still vital that homes be equipped with working smoke detectors in order to give families those critical extra seconds to escape.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>There are currently 23 million homes at risk of a fire because\xE2\x80\x94although they have smoke alarms\xE2\x80\x94the alarms are not functioning, mostly due to dead or missing batteries. Sharing the reminder to Change Your Clock Change Your Battery<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>\xC2\xA0is a simple way to help protect neighbors and loved ones. \xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CWe began the\xC2\xA0<i>Change Your Clock Change Your Battery</i><sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>program with the IAFC 25 years ago to do our part in helping to keep families safe, \xE2\x80\x9Csaid Michelle Atkinson, Vice President of Marketing for\xC2\xA0<i>Energizer</i>\xC2\xA0North America. \xE2\x80\x9CToday it\xE2\x80\x99s amazing to look back and see how the more than four million batteries donated through hundreds of neighborhood canvasses has translated to countless lives being saved. It\xE2\x80\x99s another example of our philosophy of\xC2\xA0<i>that\xE2\x80\x99s positivenergy</i><sub>\xE2\x84\xA2</sub>\xC2\xA0brought to life. We are grateful to the IAFC and local fire departments across the country for helping us share this message and make a positive impact.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The 25<sup>th</sup>\xC2\xA0anniversary of Change Your Clock Change Your Battery<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>\xC2\xA0kicked off Oct. 1 in Chicago, where the Chicago Fire Department was joined by MLB Hall of Famer and\xC2\xA0<i>that\xE2\x80\x99s positivenergy</i><sub>\xE2\x84\xA2</sub>\xC2\xA0Ambassador Cal Ripken, Jr. to honor the anniversary of the Great Chicago Fire. The Energizer Bunny<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>Brigade recreated the scene of the O\xE2\x80\x99Leary Barn, where by legend the fire started, and firefighters provided a fire safety demonstration for local students. Following, Ripken led the first of the neighborhood canvasses with fire officials in Southside Chicago who conducted fire safety inspections and surprised homeowners with Family Safety Kits, stocked with products designed to help keep homes safe including Kidde smoke detectors,\xC2\xA0<i>Energizer</i><sub>\xC2\xAE\xC2\xA0</sub>MAX<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>\xC2\xA0batteries and\xC2\xA0<i>Energizer</i><sub>\xC2\xAE</sub>Weatheready<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>\xC2\xA0flashlights.</p><p>&#13;\n\

  title: Waltham officials evacuate 25 families from 1105 Lexington St.
  community_id: "30"
  url: http://pubapi.outside.in/r?url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/waltham/2012/10/waltham_officials_evacuate_25.html&publication_id=0&placement=list&region_name=Lexington_MA
  content: "<div><div><p class=\"byline\">By Jaclyn Reiss and Evan Allen, Town Correspondents</p>\n\n\
    <p>Approximately 25 families are being evacuated from condominiums in Waltham after part of the roof blew off two buildings, according to Waltham police. </p>\n\n\
    <p>Waltham Mayor Jeannette McCarthy said that the evacuations were taking place at 1105 Lexington St. after a building inspector declared it unsafe at 6:05 p.m. No one was injured, fire department officials said. </p>\n\n\
    <p>The Waltham Fire Department was called out to the condo complex first around 5 p.m., but cleared the scene. They were then called back out at about 6 p.m., McCarthy said. </p>\n\n\
    <p>At the complex on Monday night, two three-story buildings - labeled numbers eight and 11 - had visibly damaged roofs that looked as if they had been peeled back. One of the roofs extended about 10 feet over the edge of the building, and could be seen waving in the wind. Scraps of metal and wood littered the ground near the buildings, and caution tape marked off the buildings.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Tim McMahon, 32, who lives in between the two damaged buildings, said he remembers that the roofs had been replaced a couple of years ago.</p>\n\n\
    <p>McMahon said that at about 2:30 p.m., he heard a noise that sounded like thunder and then the fire alarm in one of the buildings next to him, but could not tell what was wrong until fire department officials showed up to evacuate the buildings.</p>\n\n\
    <p>\"[The roof] was blatantly peeled back,\xC2\x94 McMahon said. \xC2\x93It doesn\xC2\x92t look good. It doesn\xC2\x92t look sturdy.\xC2\x94</p>\n\n\
    <p>McMahon said that the roof also made a distinct creaking noise as it blew in the wind.</p>\n\n\
    <p>\"Every little noise makes you want to take a step back,\" he said.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Fire officials said they could not answer if the roof's condition is deemed secure as Hurricane Sandy's wind continues to blow it back and forth tonight. </p>\n\n\
    <p>\"Everybody is cleared there, and it has been turned over to the building's owners,\" said Waltham Fire Deputy Chief Andrew Mullin. </p>\n\n\
    <p>McCarthy said that officials directed the evacuees to the city's emergency shelter at Jonathan Bright Elementary School at 260 Grove St. However, most families have made arrangements to stay with friends and family, McCarthy said. </p>\n\n\
    <p>She said that the city has 150 cots and blankets for evacuees, which would have been enough to accommodate all 25 families if needed. </p>\n\n\
    <p>McCarthy said other than one other person using the emergency shelter, this is the only larger-scale evacuation in the city that officials are aware of. </p>\n\n\

    <p>As <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpatchogue.patch.com%2farticles%2fpower-outages-piling-up-in-pat-med">power outages pile up</a>, some families may only have their cell phone available for accessing information. Should this happen, here are a number of phone settings to change in order to prolong your battery for as long as possible.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Turn Off Unnecessary Connections</strong></p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>For those with iPhones, Android or other smartphones, you can extend the battery by turning off WiFi, 4G and/or 3G connections if available, or even putting your phone into airplane mode and only taking it off when you want to use the phone. All of these connections use battery up whether using it or not.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Close All Background Applications</strong></p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Smartphones have apps, and sometimes they are running even when you do not want them to. If using an iPhone, double tap the home button to bring up a list of open applications at the bottom of your screen. Press and hold one of the icons, and then tap the red circle with the white horzontal line in it to deactivate each of them. If using an Android device, enter the device settings, and select "Manage Applications." There you can see which apps are running. Select the app you want to stop, and select the "Force Stop" option.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Lower Brightness Levels</strong></p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>In your phone's settings menu, reduce the brightness of the screen to the lowest acceptable level.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Keep Use To A Minimum</strong></p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>This may be a given, but other than necessary information try to keep phone use to a minimum. Especially for those with phones loaded with movies, music and other games. Try to stick to necessary calls, texts and checking news information like <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpatchogue.patch.com%2ftopics%2fhurricane-sandy-long-island">on Patch</a>.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><em>Stay safe, and Patch will continue to update with storm information.</em></p>

    <p>They don't scare easy.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>For the past 10 years, the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.halloweeninlexington.com%2f\">Lexington Retailers Association has hosted a \"Halloween Trick or Treat\" with local businesss</a> around town.This year's is scheduled for 2 to 5 p.m. on Halloween, this Wedesday, Oct. 31. And, according to Jerry Michelson of the LRA, Hurricane Sandy hasn't changed those plans.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Last year's freak Octoboer snowstorm caused the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexington.patch.com%2farticles%2fretailers-association-trick-or-treat-postponed\">Trick or Treat to be postponed for a few days</a>, but Michelson said late last week that he's hopeful it won't happen again this year. The association, however, would push the event back a few days should town officials request they do so due to storm-related damage, as was the case last year, he said.</p><p>&#13;\n\

It traces how America&#8217;s move to independence was reported at the time in American and English newspapers. Every section shows some actual eighteenth-century news reports alongside a historian&#8217;s analysis of the event. </p><p>I wrote two sections. The first is on the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fPowder%2520Alarm">&#8220;Powder Alarm&#8221;</a> of September 1774, which signaled the <i>de facto</i> end of royal rule in most of New England; that doesn&#8217;t get a lot of space in most histories of the war because, well, nobody died. But it was a big deal for newspapers. Whig <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fprinters">printers</a> presented the notes of the mass gathering on <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fCambridge">Cambridge</a> common as if it were a formal meeting, and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fWilliam%2520Brattle">William Brattle</a> published a public letter trying to deny what he&#8217;d been caught saying in private&#8212;not that it did him any good.</p><p>My second essay is on the Battle of <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fLexington">Lexington</a> and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fConcord">Concord</a> eight months later. For that I took the approach of tracing how news of the event spread, starting with the first oral reports of <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fBritish%2520soldiers">British army officers</a> riding out of Boston. As with any fight, it took a while for the authorities and the press to sort out rumors, false claims, and facts. Newspapers in both America and Britain show how the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fMassachusetts%2520Provincial%2520Congress">Massachusetts Provincial Congress</a> did a much better job than Gen. <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fThomas%2520Gage">Thomas Gage</a> in spreading its version of events.

The list of contributors contains a lot of friends: Ray Raphael, Don Hagist, Ben Carp, Bob Allison, Will Tatum, Ben Irvin, Tom Fleming, as well as authors I know only through their books.

    <p>Hurricane Sandy is climbing the east coast and we're starting to feel the effects of the storm.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The peak of the storm may yet be a few hours away, and Hurricane Sandy may well affect our weather all the way into Wednesday.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Before the storm reaches us, here are seven things you can do to prepare:</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ul><li><strong>Remove yard items: </strong>Take in Halloween decorations, political signs, tables and chairs, barrels, trash cans and anything else that can get swept up by the wind and become dangerous.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>Power up: </strong>Recharge everything, including laptops and cell phones.</li>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>School was cancelled today in Revere and Copley-Fairlawn and across the country, and, at its peak, more than 5,000 Bath Township households were without power.

  title: Ohio University men's basketball team predicted to win Mid-American Conference East Division championship
  community_id: "31"

    <p>CLEVELAND, Ohio - The consensus is that the Ohio Bobcats will run the table in the 
    2012-2013 Mid-American Conference men&#8217;s basketball season. That hasn&#8217;t 
    been done since Kent State in 2008.</p><p>But with five starters back plus an experienced, albeit new coach in Jim
     Christian, the team that rose from third during the 2012 MAC regular 
    season to win the 2012 MAC Tournament is expected to continue its roll 
    this season. <br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;This is a very mature group with some high expectations,&#8221; Christian said.</p>
    <p>The only real challenge is expected to come from the Akron Zips, the defending MAC regular-season champs and a team the Bobcats narrowly topped in the MAC Tournament, 64-63. OU was awarded 141 tallies to 122 for the Zips. Kent State was picked third with 89.&nbsp;</p><p>OU&#8217;s 2012 roll extended to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament, landing coach John Groce a new gig at Illinois. Enter Christian, who had a five-year run as head coach at Kent State which included a pair of NCAA Tournament appearances (2005, 2008) plus the last MAC team (2008) to rank in the AP Top 25 during the regular season.</p><p>Several teams, including Western Michigan, Kent State, Northern Illinois and Central Michigan, are loaded with youth and inexperience, which is a cause of concern for WMU coach Steve Hawkins.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;I think you might see something you seldom see in this league, which is blowouts,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If (the youth) don&#8217;t get it, they&#8217;re not going to get beat, they&#8217;re going to get drilled.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>The favorites don&#8217;t have that concern. The Zips (22-12, 13-3 last season) return four of five starters from a team that split its two regular season games with OU last season before falling in the MAC Tournament. &nbsp;</p><p>In the MAC West, the Toledo Rockets (143) are favored over defending division champion Eastern Michigan (118). However, Toledo will not be eligible for the MAC Tournament or the postseason due to NCAA academic sanctions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mid-American Conference East Division projected order of finish</strong></p>
    
    <p>1. Ohio &#8211; 141</p><p>2. Akron &#8211; 122 </p>

  content: "<div><div>\n\
    <p>Ohio has already been affected by the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2f2012%2f10%2f29%2fhurricane-sandy-eyes-dc-baltimore_n_2037749.html\">FrankenStorm, also known as Hurricane Sandy</a>, but our neighbors to the east are getting hit much worse.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>And if you're safe and sound at home, you may feel compelled to do something to help them. There are many ways to help, we're just featuring two options in this story: American Red Cross and Salvation Army.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><h2></h2><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>When the electricity goes out and people need shelter, it's usually the American Red Cross that sets up those shelters in schools, churches or community centers.\xC2\xA0They provide cots to sleep on, food and a safe place to rest.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Sunday, the Red Cross had already set up <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.redcross.org%2fnews%2fpress-release%2fThousands-Look-to-Red-Cross-For-Shelter-from-Sandy\">112 shelters in nine states</a>. That's just the beginning.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>But all that costs money and while the Red Cross was created by the U.S. government, it doesn't get money from the government. That's why they ask the public for help.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Want to help financially?</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>People can <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.redcross.org\">give online through the Red Cross website</a>\xC2\xA0or call 1-800-RED-CROSS or they can text the word REDCROSS to 90999 to make a $10 donation.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Want to volunteer?</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Give blood. The Red Cross provides about 40 percent of the nation's blood supply and the storm has forced many blood drive cancelations, they have reported on their website. Find your local donation place by <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.redcrossblood.org\">checking out the website</a> or call 1-800-RED-CROSS.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    &#13;\n\
    </p><h2></h2><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Salvation Army doesn't just ring bells at Christmas time in the malls. They help people with that money they raise.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>And they're ready to help support emergency crews helping those affected by Hurricane Sandy with supplies that they can transport in their own disaster vehicles, Major David Dunham of the Summit County branch said in a prepared statement.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Want to help financially?\xC2\xA0</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>You can <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.salvationarmyusa.org\">give online</a> or by calling 1-800-SAL-ARMY(1-800-725-2769).\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>You can also text STORM to 80888 and it will automatically make a donation of $10 through your cell phone. Just respond 'yes' to confirm the donation.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>They aren't accepting clothing or furniture for those affected by the hurricane, but perhaps folks closer to home could use that stuff, so consider donating it to the Salvation Army store.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Want to volunteer?\xC2\xA0</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.disaster.salvationarmyusa.org\">Register online</a> but note you have to undergo disaster training first; not everybody who volunteers will be called to help.\xC2\xA0</p>\n\

  content: "<div><div><p>By Helen Mastro</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>School mornings are stressful enough as it is: getting the kids ready for school, making sure homework is packed, and catching the bus can feel like an entire day of its own. But before sending them off to school, you should consider what you packed for their lunch, and more importantly, how you packed it.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>While children may want to tote their sandwiches in their favorite cartoon-themed lunch box, many lunch boxes are not the safest way to carry food. Perishable items like mayonnaise, milk, leftover meats or cold cuts may not stay sufficiently cold to prevent bacterial growth on the food. Harmful bacteria multiply between 40 and 140 degrees, and might subject your children to food-borne illness.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>According to USDA food safety guidelines, insulated bags or boxes plus an ice pack are best for keeping foods cold.\xC2\xA0 As many come in cartoon and themed designs, your children can still bring their favorite lunch bag to school with an ice pack in it, which keeps food at safe temperatures. Older children who have outgrown sporting a lunchbox should use an insulated tote over a brown bag. Unlike a brown bag, the totes have an insulated lining that accompanies a freezer pack to help keep food cold.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In addition to ensuring your children\xE2\x80\x99s food is kept at a safe temperature, you should also carefully consider what to pack in their lunch box. For starters, pack some protein. Food packed with protein tends to keep people fuller longer. A turkey sandwich on whole-wheat bread or baked chicken breasts (and remember: leftovers should be prepared safely and chilled well!) are good choices.\xC2\xA0 Raw vegetables, fruit, yogurt, and trail mix or granola bars also are wise choices since they are packed with nutrition. Make sure snacks are low in fat and sugar (less than 2 grams of fat, less than 10 grams of sugar). When it comes to beverages, skip the juice box and give your children water or a milk box.\xC2\xA0 As an added bonus, you can put these drinks in the freezer overnight. The drink can serve as extra insulation to keep the lunchbox cold.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Before your children dig into their healthy lunch, have them wash their hands first. Soap and water does the job fine, but if not available, pack an antibacterial wipe or a small bottle of hand sanitizer (depending on child\xE2\x80\x99s age) in their backpack which they can use to clean their hands and their area of the lunch table before unpacking their food. You should also clean their lunchbox occasionally to reduce the spread of germs. A disinfecting spray or washing it in the sink with warm, soapy water will do the trick.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>By using these tips, you can help ensure that your children have a great and healthy day at school!</p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; A construction worker checking a job site in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy was swept to his death by a landslide Tuesday in Lincoln as utility crews elsewhere worked to restore power to hundreds of thousands of customers across the state.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>After peaking at about 210,000, the number of outages had dropped to about 128,000 by Tuesday afternoon, and officials said all should be resolved by Saturday. Most outages appeared to be caused by downed lines, not topped poles that take longer to fix, said Public Utilities Commission Chairwoman Amy Ignatius.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In Lincoln, Police Chief Theodore Smith said police were notified just before 8:30 a.m. about the fatal accident involving a construction crew checking on a home foundation they had been building. The victim&rsquo;s identity wasn&rsquo;t released.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;The embankment gave way and turned into a landslide of mud, rock and all the water that was in the hole,&rsquo;&rsquo; Smith said. &lsquo;&lsquo;It washed him down the equivalent of a 2-3 story incline.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Other members of the construction crew pulled the man out of the debris and started CPR, but he was declared dead in the ambulance on the way to the hospital, Smith said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The National Weather Service recorded gusts Monday evening of 60 mph in Portsmouth, 62 mph in Londonderry and 76 mph at the Isle of Shoals, 6 miles off the coast. Forecasters said rainfall could reach 4 inches. Mount Washington recorded a peak wind gust of 140 mph.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In Windham, a powerful gust caused a tree to fall on a vehicle Monday evening, leaving a man critically injured. Windham police were unable to provide details.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>It was the fourth worst storm in terms of power outages in state history, affecting about 30 percent of customers receiving electricity in the state. The worst was in December 2008 when an ice storm knocked out electricity to 422,000 homes and businesses, Ignatius said. A wind storm in February 2010 affected 360,000 customers and last October&rsquo;s snowstorm cut power to 315,000.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In Durham, downed trees left residents along a stretch of Durham Point Road stranded Tuesday, though one resident said she and her neighbors were taking it in stride. Katie Delahaye Paine, who runs a public relations firm from her Durham home and an office in Berlin, said was relieved to find out that her 94-year-old cousin who lives down the road was at a rehab center and not at home and that other neighbors also had checked on him.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s very sort of classic New Hampshire &mdash; people sitting there saying, &lsquo;If I could just get a bulldozer onto that tree, I could get it out of the way,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;&lsquo;Great neighborhood spirit.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The road also was humming with the noise of power generators, she said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Five years ago, you'd go for a run or walk the morning after a storm and it would be deadly quiet. Now, there&rsquo;s a generator at every single house,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Paine, who fired hers up to power her refrigerator, coffee pot and computer.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In Manchester, Nancy Crowley&rsquo;s power went out around 9 p.m. Monday. The only surprise was that it stayed on as long as it did.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;We've been very consistently hit every time, so I was expecting it much earlier,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Crowley, 43, who bought a generator after last October&rsquo;s snowstorm left her family in the dark for nine days. &lsquo;&lsquo;I was a little deflated when the power went out.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Gov. John Lynch said Sandy did not cause the extensive and damaging flooding of past storms, but comparisons don&rsquo;t matter much to those people who are without electricity.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s still pretty significant to them,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>President Barack Obama on Tuesday granted Lynch&rsquo;s request to issue an emergency disaster declaration for all 10 counties.  It will make federal assistance available for impacted communities. State officials urged local government officials to keep records of any spending to aid in getting reimbursed.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Five shelters opened Monday, but Health and Human Services Commissioner Nick Toumpas said only 57 people went to the shelters and of those, only 43 spent the night in them.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The storm swept away plans by the presidential campaigns to hold events in New Hampshire, but campaigning for state offices resumed Tuesday. And former President Bill Clinton was expected to return to campaign this week for President Obama.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Ignatius said polling places should be open with power and telephone lines on Election Day.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="">
    <p>At the Children&rsquo;s Museum of New Hampshire, the phone started ringing early Tuesday morning as parents looked for alternatives to spending the day at home with their children and no power. There was a line waiting at the door when the museum opened at 10 a.m., said marketing director Heidi Duncanson.

    <p><strong>1. No School Today: </strong>For the second straight day, Hurricane Sandy has washed out the Concord Public Schools. Superintendent Diana Rigby confirmed Monday night that there will be no school today, Oct. 30. <strong><br></strong></p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>2. Decision About Town Offices Imminent: </strong>In an email to Patch Monday night, Town Manager Chris Whelan said he plans to speak with Fire Chief Mark  Cotreau and and CMLP Director Dave Wood at 6 a.m. this morning and  will  decide then about opening Town offices.</p><p>&#13;

    </p><p><strong>4. Stay Informed: </strong>We'll keep our <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2farticles%2fhurricane-sandy-concord-info-center">Hurricane Sandy Information Center</a> up and running throughout the day, updating it with the latest local news. <strong><br></strong></p><p>&#13;

    <p>Halloween is fun and trick or treating for free candy, as any child will tell you, is just plain awesome. However, there are risks and we must do what we can to make the holiday as safe as possible for the little ghouls and ghosts roaming the neighborhoods.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Here are some safety tips from security consultant and <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexington.patch.com%2fblog_posts%2fhalloween-safety-tips-e84c115e\">Patch blogger David Cullen</a>.\xC2\xA0 Check them out and go over the trick-or-treating safety  tips with any child heading <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpatch.com%2fA-zc1k\">out in search of candy tomorrow</a>\xC2\xA0on Halloween. It will only take a  few minutes and could make a big difference.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>FOR TRICK-OR-TREATERS:</strong></p><p>1. Carry a flashlight and walk, don't run. </p><p>2. Stay on sidewalks; obey traffic signals. </p><p>3. Stay in familiar neighborhoods. </p><p>4. Don't cut across yards or driveways. </p><p>5. Wear a watch you can read in the dark. </p><p>6. Make sure costumes don't drag on the ground. </p><p>7. Shoes should fit (even if they don't go with your costume). </p><p>8. Avoid wearing masks while walking from house to house. </p><p>9. Carry only flexible knives, swords or other props. </p><p>10. (lf no sidewalk) walk on left side of the road facing traffic. </p><p>11. Wear clothing with reflective markings/tape. </p><p>12. Approach only houses that are lit. </p><p>13. Stay away from and don't pet animals you don't know.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>FOR PARENTS:</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>1. Make sure your child eats dinner before setting out. </p><p>2. Children should carry quarters so they can call home or consider the pluses/minuses of a cell phone. </p><p>3. Ideally, an adult should accompany young children of any age. </p><p>4. If your children go on their own, be sure they wear a watch, preferably one that can be read in the dark. </p><p>5. lf you buy a costume, look for one made of flame- retardant material. </p><p>6. Older children should know where to reach you and when they need to be home. </p><p>7. You should know where they're going. </p><p>8. Although tampering is rare, tell children to bring candy home to be inspected before consuming anything. </p><p>9. Look at the wrapping carefully and toss out anything that looks suspect.</p><p><strong>FOR HOMEOWNERS </strong></p><p>1. Make sure your yard is clear of such things as ladders, hoses, dog leashes, flower pots, etc. that can trip young ones. </p><p>2. Pets get frightened on Halloween. Put them someplace to protect them from cars or inadvertently biting a trick-or-treater.</p><p>3.  Battery powered jack o'lantern candles are preferable to a real flame.  If you do use candles, place the pumpkin well away from were  trick-or-treaters will be walking or standing. Make sure paper or cloth  yard decorations won't be blown into a flaming candle. </p><p>4.  Healthy food alternatives for trick-or-treaters include pre-packaged  low-fat crackers with cheese or peanut butter filling, single-serve  boxes of cereal, packaged fruit rolls, mini boxes of raisins and  single-serve packets of low-fat popcorn that can be microwaved later.  Non-food treats: plastic rings, pencils, stickers, erasers, coins, etc. </p><p><strong>BEFORE TRICK OR TREATING: </strong></p><p>1.  Plan costumes that are bright and reflective. Make sure that shoes fit I  well and that costumes are short enough to prevent tripping,  entanglement or contact with flame. </p><p>2. Consider adding reflective tape or striping to costumes and trick-or-treat bags for greater visibility. </p><p>3.  Secure emergency identification (name, address, phone number)  discreetly within Halloween attire or on a bracelet. Not on the outside  of clothing where anyone can see it. </p><p>4. Because a mask can limit  or block eyesight, consider non-toxic and hypoallergenic makeup or a  decorative hat as a safe alternative. </p><p>5. When shopping for costumes, wigs and accessories purchase only those with a label indicating they are flame resistant. </p><p>6.  Think twice before using simulated knives, guns or swords. If such  props must be used, be certain they do not appear authentic and are soft  and flexible to prevent injury. </p><p>7. Obtain flashlights with fresh batteries for all children and their escorts. </p><p>8. Plan ahead to use only battery powered lanterns or chemical\xC2\xA0light sticks\xC2\xA0in place of candles in decorations and costumes. </p><p>9. This is also a great time to buy fresh batteries for your smoke alarms.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Now that you's safe, have fun and take pictures! </strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p>\n\

    <li>Police and Fire Departments have added additional staff and crews to handle extra emergency incidents over the last 24-hours.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>The Town is utilizing private tree companies to supplement on-duty public works staff with removal of downed trees and cleanup.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Tree crews are working with NSTAR who de-energize power temporally allowing tree crews to remove downed trees. This may cause additional brief power outages during the day.\xC2\xA0</li>&#13;\n\

Sidewalks and some streets still have significant tree debris allowing for limited safe passage. Use caution and common sense when traveling these sidewalks and roadways. Tree debris from resident\xE2\x80\x99s property can be transported to the Compost Facility on Hartwell Avenue, which is opened today. Trash pick-up is delayed one-day all week.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>Just before noontime on Tuesday, Oct. 30, more than 2,400 NSTAR customers in Lexington are still without power and reports of downed trees and limbs abound.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The town website includes the warning: \"Throughout town there is  extensive tree damage, with downed wires and\xC2\xA0power outages.\xC2\xA0Do not approach downed wires.\xC2\xA0 Consider all wires to be live.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>What it doesn't say, as of noontime anyway, is which roads are blocked and and where the wires are downed. Meanwhile, your local editor still doesn't have power and is stuck out in central Mass.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>So help us help you help your neighbors stay safe and navigate the town. If you see a road closed with downed limbs or wires, add the location to the comment section below, tweet it to me at <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ftwitter.com%2flexingtonpatch\">@LexingtonPatch</a> post it to our <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ffacebook.com%2flexingtonpatch\">Facebook page</a> or email me at <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexington.patch.com%2farticles%2fmailto%3apatrick.ball%40patch.com\">Patrick.Ball@patch.com</a>.

Check with your local wine shop, and if they don&rsquo;t have the wine you are looking for, they can probably get it for you.

    <p>Data from the study at 25 U.S. sites will be used to support a pre-market application for EndoBarrier, a thin, flexible, tube-shaped liner that forms a physical barrier between food and a portion of the wall of the intestine.</p>
    <p>The company said that in 12 clinical studies conducted globally and one in the U.S., involving more than 500 patients, EndoBarrier has been shown to achieve rapid reductions in blood sugar levels, improvement of cardiovascular risk factors including blood pressure, cholesterol and triglycerides, and weight loss of about 20 percent in 12 months.</p>
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>EndoBarrier is currently commercially available in select countries in Europe, including Germany, Austria, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, as well as Australia and Chile.</p>

    <p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>When we moved into our new home a year ago I was thrilled, great town, great schools, great next door neighbors. Life was good. I did however begin to miss living in a traditional neighborhood. We live on a bust street and while I do like the constant hustle and bustle of that, I worried we wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t get to know our extended neighbors. I chalked it up to one of the few things I would have to give up living in our new house, could be worse.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xC2\xA0Life was moving along fairly well and we had a great relationship with our next door neighbors from day one. Soon, new neighbors moved in behind us and we started enjoying playing with their son, sharing a glass of wine and just hanging out. Soon I was introduced to another family on the other side of our block. A play date came next and then the idea of a block party. I thought at least there would be four families to anchor my attempt to create a neighborhood. I joined forces with my next door neighbor, made flyers and reached out to several other families on our block and down our street. The RSVP\xE2\x80\x99s came rolling in and I started getting very excited.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>As if it was all meant to be the pending hurricane held off, the skies were clear and the air warm. The kids helped with set up carefully placing their outdoor toys around the yard for their new friends to enjoy. \xC2\xA0Leaves were raked, the lawn was cut and we even managed to get the driveway safety net up for rolling balls or runaway toddlers. I used the sidewalk chalk to write a message of welcome to our new friends and my son offered up his birthday balloons for the party. Neighbors showed up with fun side dishes, kids came with bikes and scooters. The young and the not so young played, ate good food and got to know one another. I shook a lot of hands, asked for reminders of names several times and pointed out my house to my new friends feeling all the while very satisfied with my efforts to create a neighborhood on my busy street.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The day turned to night, the younger kids went home for bed and an outdoor fire kept the older kids and adults happy for hours. I learned that my son has two neighborhood kids that would be attending Kindergarten with him next year, that my daughter is great at making a little ones feel comfortable with the big kids and that my neighbor who recently lost her husband is doing OK and still has her great sense of humor.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>When midnight rolled around (yes, midnight) and the last log fizzled out we packed it up and called it a day/night. And as the last guest waved goodbye and I repeated their names as not to forget I thought about the next block party with what would then be old friends and maybe even some new. I always thought the sign of a successful party was thinking about the next with eager anticipation. I can\xE2\x80\x99t wait to throw our next block party! \xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0</p>\n\

Price, who is black, even volunteered for the campaign.</p>
    <p>Price became disillusioned when the president abandoned his push for a public insurance option in his health care bill and extended the George W. Bush-era tax cuts.</p>
    <p>When President Obama embraced same-sex marriage in May, "that was the last straw for me," said Price, 52, an ordained minister who owns a Cincinnati business and technology consulting firm. He decided to boycott the Nov. 6 election.</p>
    <p>But watching the vice presidential candidates discuss abortion in their debate, Price had a change of heart. "We've had 54 million babies murdered in this country," said Price, referring to the number of legal abortions since the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. "The Lord spoke to me in a very clear way."</p>                                                <div class="medcity-paid-inline">
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    <p>Advertisement</p></div>
    											
    <p>This year, he will vote for Republican Mitt Romney.</p>
    <p>The idea that black voters will desert Obama in meaningful numbers is unthinkable to most political observers. But in Ohio, whose voters will probably determine who lives in the White House for the next four years, a question flickers like a tiny flame of hope for some Republicans: Could a small number of black voters, sufficiently angry or disappointed with the president, be persuaded to vote against him? If so, could that make a difference in the outcome?</p>
    <p>"Put it this way," said Leonard Hubert, 59, a black lifelong Republican from Granville, near Cincinnati, and a member of the Ohio Civil Rights Commission. "They are less enthused and energized about Obama. Some are going to vote for Romney and some are going to not vote at all."</p>
    <p>Just about everyone who follows politics in Ohio thinks there will be a drop in African-American support for Obama, who earned 96 percent of the black vote here in 2008. The question is, how much?</p>
    <p>"I think it would be in the narrowest sense a victory for the Romney campaign if he could hold President Obama's take of the African-American vote in Ohio to 90 percent," said former Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell, who is African-American. That could mean tens of thousands of votes, a sliver of the total, but potentially crucial in a tight contest.</p>
    <p>Still, many black conservatives said they were frustrated at what they thought was a missed opportunity. While the Democratic Party takes the black vote for granted, they say, the Republican Party assumes it is unobtainable.</p>
    <p>"The marriage issue, the life issue, the fact that black unemployment is still double, even in Ohio," Blackwell said. "There's a collection of issues that have fed discontent and provides an opportunity for swinging 6 percent."</p>
    <p>It's clear that things are different from four years ago.</p>
    <p>On Wednesday night, the Cleveland gospel radio station Praise 1300 hosted a lively debate among black callers. One man compared Obama's embrace of same-sex marriage to the "coming of Sodom and Gomorrah," but said he planned to vote for him anyway.</p>
    <p>A woman who said she was a graduate of Howard University said, "I don't see anything the president has done for me personally. It just sickens me to think everybody wants to vote for him. I am for Mitt Romney. I am for biblical principles."</p>
    <p>Republicans often point out that in 2004, President George W. Bush received a surprisingly high 18 percent of the black vote in Ohio, but, as Blackwell noted, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage on the state ballot that year helped drive turnout.</p>
    <p>Voters face no such proposal this year, but some conservatives are hoping to arouse some of the same anti-gay-marriage sentiments.</p>
    <p>One obstacle they face: After the president spoke in support of gay marriage, the NAACP endorsed the position as well. Black support for same-sex marriage went up almost instantly across the country, including from some unexpected quarters.</p>
    <p>"When rappers start coming out in favor of gay rights," said Eric McDaniel, a University of Texas government professor who studies race, religion and politics, "you know something has changed."</p>
    <p>McDaniel challenged the assumption that African-Americans would defect from Obama in any meaningful way over gay marriage or any other social issue.</p>
    <p>"These issues don't mobilize African-Americans," he said. "They might be opposed to gay marriage, but it's not something they are going to march over. ... At the end of the day, African-Americans see a better way to work with the Obama administration than they do with the Romney administration."</p>
    <p>Matt Borges, executive chairman of the Ohio GOP, could not name any specific outreach to black voters. Tara Wall, who handles African-American outreach for the Romney campaign, suggested contacting the Ohio Black Republican Association, but neither the president nor past president of the group responded to phone calls or emails.</p>
    <p>Borges was not aware of the work done by a new political action committee, Republican Union PAC, which has put up anti-Obama billboards in black communities, including Detroit and Cleveland, in five swing states. "Obama supports gay marriage &amp; abortion. Do you?" the billboard says.</p>
    <p>Some black conservatives are more ambitious than the Republican establishment appears to be.</p>
    <p>"We want to peel away 20 to 25 percent of the black vote in the swing states," said Claver Kamau-Imani, an Austin, Texas-based Republican activist. Recently, with a number of high-profile conservative African-American religious leaders, he created "God Said," a campaign aimed at pushing black voters to reconsider their allegiance to the president.</p>
    <p>"God Said" has produced a 30-second spot that Kamau-Imani said would air 50 times in the next week in Columbus on the BET cable network. "God said marriage equals one man and one woman," says a narrator over photos of a heterosexual African-American couple. "We agree. On Nov. 6, use your right to vote his values."</p>
    <p>Kamau-Imani said the group would also buy airtime in cities in three other toss-up states: Tallahassee, Fla., Norfolk, Va., and Milwaukee.</p>
    <p>The efforts of "God Said" are minuscule compared with the nonstop barrage of other political advertising on Ohio's airwaves. But its message is reinforced by other conservative black groups, such as the Frederick Douglass Foundation, a conservative Christian advocacy group in Virginia, and the Atlanta-based Coalition of African-American Pastors, which opposes same-sex marriage and works closely with the National Organization for Marriage.</p>
    <p>Last Tuesday, two CAAP officials were in Cleveland at the Williams Temple Church of God in Christ, a Pentecostal church, working out details for a news conference and Bible teach-in Thursday. The Rev. William Owens said the group hoped to capitalize on the media focus on Ohio to spread its message that Obama "betrayed the black community by endorsing same-sex marriage."</p>
    <p>One observer thinks there could be some fallout for Obama.</p>
    <p>"I think it is possible that these messages might reduce the black vote for Obama on the margins," said John Green, director of the Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron. "Even so, the black vote will likely be 90 percent or more Democratic this year."</p>
    <p>Frederick Douglass Foundation founder Timothy Johnson conceded that some black voters were conflicted over whether to abandon the first black president.</p>
    <p>But, he added, "It only tugs at your heartstrings if race trumps faith," he said. "Do we stand by our faith, or do we stand by the color of his skin?"</p>

  summary: Just about everyone who follows politics in Ohio thinks there will be a drop in African-American support for Obama, who earned 96 percent of the black vote here in 2008. The question is, how much?

    <p>Noam Chomsky, a man not necessarily known for brevity, needed only three words to steal the show in MIT's tremendous parody of\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3ffeature%3dplayer_embedded%26amp%3bv%3d9bZkp7q19f0\">Korean pop sensation Psy's \"Gangnam Style\" music video</a>.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>There's music and dancing and mascots and a capella and horse heads and even a Barstool Blackout-style club scene. And then, at about the 3:20 mark, it happens: The music stops and there's Chomsky, who sips from his cup of tea, looks up and deadpans, \"Oppan Chomsky style.\"\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>By Tuesday afternoon, the MIT parody had been seen more than 500,000 times on YouTube, which, while impressive, is less than 1/10th as many times as the original, according to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2f2012%2f10%2f29%2fmit-chomsky-style-best-gagnam-style-parody-yet_n_2040053.html%3fncid%3dedlinkusaolp00000003\">HuffPost College</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    &#13;\n\
    </p><p>More about the video, from HuffPost:\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><blockquote>&#13;\n\
    <p>The MIT Admissions blog notes that\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fmitadmissions.org%2fblogs%2fentry%2fmit-gangnam-style\">the video took weeks to produce</a>.

Besides the video's star, fellow MIT student Richard Yoon and the MIT Korean Students Association, the video also features several varsity athletic teams, the MIT mascot, the school's Dean of Admissions, an a cappella group and more than a few surprisingly energetic professors, not to mention MIT's most famous educator, Chomsky.</p>&#13;\n\

He knew the odds of getting a 36 were pretty crazy, but just maybe...</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Turns out Alan was the only student in Copley High to score a perfect 36 this year on his ACT and he couldn't be more pleased. <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fcollegeapps.about.com%2fod%2ftheact%2ff%2fgoodactscore.htm\">According to collegeapps.com</a>, \"Anyone scoring a 34, 35 or 36 is among the top 1 percent of test-takers in the country.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.facebook.com%2ffairlawnbathpatch\">Fairlawn-Bath Patch</a>\xC2\xA0was pretty impressed, so we sat down with Alan to find out his secrets to success.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    &#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>F-B Patch:\xC2\xA0</strong>What are your secrets to success?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Alan: </strong>I study hard, make sure I'm focused and I try not to get distracted. I avoid spending too much time on social networks and I never do my homework in front of the TV.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>F-B Patch: </strong>What did you do to prepare for the ACT?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Alan: </strong>It's helpful to do practice tests. I took previous year's tests and it helped, I also went to an ACT Prep class. I think I took five practice tests. When I took the actual test, it had similar questions and it helped that I was already used to the format. Plus I was able to time myself in the practice tests so I learned time management.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>F-B Patch: </strong>Can you describe what happened the morning you found out you got a perfect score?\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Alan: </strong>I woke up around a normal time and I knew the scores were coming out so I went to check. In my gut I had a tiny feeling I had the potential to get a 36. When I checked it and saw I actually got a 36 I was extremely happy and surprised. My parents were very proud of me. They pushed me to do the practice tests and were helpful in general.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>My family (Dad, Ming; Mom, Jenny; Brother, Kevin) has been really supportive of me. They're a big part of any success I've had and I thank them for that. I also have great friends and teachers, too.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>F-B Patch:</strong> Have you applied you been accepted to any colleges? What do you want to study?\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Alan: </strong>I want to major in economics and to go into business management. I haven't been accepted into any colleges yet, but I am interested in Ivy League.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>F-B Patch:</strong>\xC2\xA0What's something not many people know about you?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Alan:</strong> Well a lot of people can't tell just by looking at me that I'm athletic (laughs). I'm the captain of the soccer team and I play tennis. I've also been president of my class since freshman year.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Congratulations, Alan! Best of luck this year!</p>\n\

    <p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>When we moved into our new home a year ago I was thrilled: Great town, great schools, great next door neighbors. Life was good. I did however begin to miss living in a traditional neighborhood. We live on a bust street and while I do like the constant hustle and bustle of that, I worried we wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t get to know our extended neighbors. I chalked it up to one of the few things I would have to give up living in our new house, could be worse.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xC2\xA0Life was moving along fairly well and we had a great relationship with our next door neighbors from day one. Soon, new neighbors moved in behind us and we started enjoying playing with their son, sharing a glass of wine and just hanging out. Soon I was introduced to another family on the other side of our block. A play date came next and then the idea of a block party. I thought at least there would be four families to anchor my attempt to create a neighborhood. I joined forces with my next door neighbor, made flyers and reached out to several other families on our block and down our street. The RSVP\xE2\x80\x99s came rolling in and I started getting very excited.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>As if it was all meant to be the pending hurricane held off, the skies were clear and the air warm. The kids helped with set up carefully placing their outdoor toys around the yard for their new friends to enjoy. \xC2\xA0Leaves were raked, the lawn was cut and we even managed to get the driveway safety net up for rolling balls or runaway toddlers. I used the sidewalk chalk to write a message of welcome to our new friends and my son offered up his birthday balloons for the party. Neighbors showed up with fun side dishes, kids came with bikes and scooters. The young and the not so young played, ate good food and got to know one another. I shook a lot of hands, asked for reminders of names several times and pointed out my house to my new friends feeling all the while very satisfied with my efforts to create a neighborhood on my busy street.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The day turned to night, the younger kids went home for bed and an outdoor fire kept the older kids and adults happy for hours. I learned that my son has two neighborhood kids that would be attending Kindergarten with him next year, that my daughter is great at making a little ones feel comfortable with the big kids and that my neighbor who recently lost her husband is doing OK and still has her great sense of humor.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>When midnight rolled around (yes, midnight) and the last log fizzled out we packed it up and called it a day/night. And as the last guest waved goodbye and I repeated their names as not to forget I thought about the next block party with what would then be old friends and maybe even some new. I always thought the sign of a successful party was thinking about the next with eager anticipation. I can\xE2\x80\x99t wait to throw our next block party! \xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0</p>\n\

    <p>Halloween is fun and trick or treating for free candy, as any child will tell you, is just plain awesome. However, there are risks and we must do what we can to make the holiday as safe as possible for the little ghouls and ghosts roaming the neighborhoods.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Here are some safety tips from security consultant and <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2fblog_posts%2fhalloween-safety-tips-e84c115e\">Patch blogger David Cullen</a>. Check them out and go over the trick-or-treating safety  tips with any child heading out in search of candy tomorrow\xC2\xA0on Halloween. It will only take a  few minutes and could make a big difference.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>FOR TRICK-OR-TREATERS:</strong></p><p>1. Carry a flashlight and walk, don't run. </p><p>2. Stay on sidewalks; obey traffic signals. </p><p>3. Stay in familiar neighborhoods. </p><p>4. Don't cut across yards or driveways. </p><p>5. Wear a watch you can read in the dark. </p><p>6. Make sure costumes don't drag on the ground. </p><p>7. Shoes should fit (even if they don't go with your costume). </p><p>8. Avoid wearing masks while walking from house to house. </p><p>9. Carry only flexible knives, swords or other props. </p><p>10. (lf no sidewalk) walk on left side of the road facing traffic. </p><p>11. Wear clothing with reflective markings/tape. </p><p>12. Approach only houses that are lit. </p><p>13. Stay away from and don't pet animals you don't know.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>FOR PARENTS:</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>1. Make sure your child eats dinner before setting out. </p><p>2. Children should carry quarters so they can call home or consider the pluses/minuses of a cell phone. </p><p>3. Ideally, an adult should accompany young children of any age. </p><p>4. If your children go on their own, be sure they wear a watch, preferably one that can be read in the dark. </p><p>5. lf you buy a costume, look for one made of flame- retardant material. </p><p>6. Older children should know where to reach you and when they need to be home. </p><p>7. You should know where they're going. </p><p>8. Although tampering is rare, tell children to bring candy home to be inspected before consuming anything. </p><p>9. Look at the wrapping carefully and toss out anything that looks suspect.</p><p><strong>FOR HOMEOWNERS </strong></p><p>1. Make sure your yard is clear of such things as ladders, hoses, dog leashes, flower pots, etc. that can trip young ones. </p><p>2. Pets get frightened on Halloween. Put them someplace to protect them from cars or inadvertently biting a trick-or-treater.</p><p>3.  Battery powered jack o'lantern candles are preferable to a real flame.  If you do use candles, place the pumpkin well away from were  trick-or-treaters will be walking or standing. Make sure paper or cloth  yard decorations won't be blown into a flaming candle. </p><p>4.  Healthy food alternatives for trick-or-treaters include pre-packaged  low-fat crackers with cheese or peanut butter filling, single-serve  boxes of cereal, packaged fruit rolls, mini boxes of raisins and  single-serve packets of low-fat popcorn that can be microwaved later.  Non-food treats: plastic rings, pencils, stickers, erasers, coins, etc. </p><p><strong>BEFORE TRICK OR TREATING: </strong></p><p>1.  Plan costumes that are bright and reflective. Make sure that shoes fit I  well and that costumes are short enough to prevent tripping,  entanglement or contact with flame. </p><p>2. Consider adding reflective tape or striping to costumes and trick-or-treat bags for greater visibility. </p><p>3.  Secure emergency identification (name, address, phone number)  discreetly within Halloween attire or on a bracelet. Not on the outside  of clothing where anyone can see it. </p><p>4. Because a mask can limit  or block eyesight, consider non-toxic and hypoallergenic makeup or a  decorative hat as a safe alternative. </p><p>5. When shopping for costumes, wigs and accessories purchase only those with a label indicating they are flame resistant. </p><p>6.  Think twice before using simulated knives, guns or swords. If such  props must be used, be certain they do not appear authentic and are soft  and flexible to prevent injury. </p><p>7. Obtain flashlights with fresh batteries for all children and their escorts. </p><p>8. Plan ahead to use only battery powered lanterns or chemical\xC2\xA0light sticks\xC2\xA0in place of candles in decorations and costumes. </p><p>9. This is also a great time to buy fresh batteries for your smoke alarms.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Now that you's safe, have fun and take pictures! </strong></p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>BTS Asset Management Inc. of Lexington claimed its investment program had &ldquo;no down years&rdquo; since its inception in January 1981.</p>
    <p>But the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission determined that ads touting the past performance were &ldquo;materially misleading&rdquo; because they failed to disclose that a &ldquo;significant number&rdquo; of clients experienced different results.</p>
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>The SEC hit BTS with a &#36;200,000 fine and censure, and required the firm to hire an independent compliance consultant to review the firm&rsquo;s policies and procedures.</p>
    <p>BTS agreed to settle the case without admitting wrongdoing.</p>
    <p>The company has about &#36;1.5 billion in assets under management and 14,000 client accounts as of May 2012, according to the SEC.</p>

    <p>The firm was aware that half its clients had lost money in 2004, regulators alleged, and yet continued to market the funds as never having fallen in value. BTS neither admitted to nor denied the charges.</p>\n\
    <p>BTS, which manages about $1.5 billion in assets, agreed to hire an independent compliance consultant, in addition to paying tthe penalty. The firm also agreed to cease and desist from further violations of the securities rules.</p>\r\n\

  content: "<div><div>\n\
    <p>A hard rain fell on and off for two days and winds whipped wildly as <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fsudbury.patch.com%2farticles%2fhurricane-sandy-massachusetts-live-blog-9a05818d\">Hurricane Sandy pummeled the region</a> for the better part of two days.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>As of late Tuesday night,\xC2\xA0power and phone issues linger in Lexington, where many trees and wires are still down and, according to NSTAR, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2foutage.nstar.com%2foutage%2f\">more than 2,300 customers were without power as of 9 p.m</a>.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>But the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flps.lexingtonma.org%2fsite%2fdefault.aspx%3fPageID%3d1\">Lexington Public Schools</a> will be back in session tomorrow, Oct. 31, and the\xC2\xA0administrative offices, along with <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexington.patch.com%2flistings%2fcary-memorial-library\">Cary Memorial Library</a>, the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexington.patch.com%2flistings%2flexington-senior-center\">Lexington Senior Center</a> and recreation programs will be open for a full day as well.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Further, trash collection will continue on its \"holiday week\" schedule of a day later than the norm, and the local bus service,\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexington.patch.com%2flistings%2flexpress\">Lexpress</a>,\xC2\xA0will be running, although detours on routes 1 and 5 are possible if roads have not been cleared, according to a town communication.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>More good news: Halloween's happening.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexington.patch.com%2farticles%2flexington-s-annual-trick-or-treat-with-local-businesses-set-for-halloween\">Lexington Retailers Association's annual Trick or Treat with Local Businesses</a>\xC2\xA0is still on for from 2 to 5 p.m. tomorrow, and night time trick-or-treating is a go, as well. Regarding the latter, given the road and sidewalk conditions, officials are advising that \"parents should make sure trick-or-treaters are safe in the dark,\xC2\xA0and stay away from downed trees and wires.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Hurricane Sandy felt like it was hitting hardest on Monday, Oct. 29, but the downed limbs, trees and wires continued to take a toll deep into Tuesday.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Reported power outages fluctuated some throughout the day, but the number was consistently above 2,000, according to NSTAR's outage map. A\xC2\xA0midday <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexington.patch.com%2farticles%2flexington-recovery-continues\">press release from Fire Chief John Wilson</a>\xC2\xA0reported\xC2\xA0six streets blocked by fallen trees and power lines, forcing traffic detours at Mass Ave at Audubon, Lowell Street at 508 (near East Street); Grant Street at Sherman; Grove Street at Tidd Circle; Charles Street at Camden Street; and Shade Street.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Then, and now, it's important to remember to avoid downed wires and consider them all to be live. And, one more time, here's a few numbers to remember as phone and power problems persist:\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\

  title: Benn challenges Atkins for state representative
  community_id: "37"
  url: http://pubapi.outside.in/r?url=http://feeds.boston.com/click.phdo?i%3D7800574baecaf69b7b6db63d2f114872&publication_id=0&placement=list&region_name=Carlisle_MA

    <div><div>
    					<div class="firstGraph">
    <p>State Representative Cory Atkins,&nbsp;a Concord Democrat who believes the state is doing a lot of things right, is seeking a seventh term in a race against Republican challenger Michael J. Benn,&nbsp;who says the one-party control on Beacon Hill has government &ldquo;out of balance.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Atkins, 65, and Benn, 47, are vying to represent the 14th Middlesex District, which covers all of Concord and Carlisle, and parts of Acton and Chelmsford.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Benn, who grew up in Concord, has served on the town&rsquo;s Public Ceremonies and Celebrations Committee,&nbsp;is active in the Knights of Columbus and in his church, where he taught Catholic religious education, and spent time coaching his children&rsquo;s youth soccer teams.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>After graduating from Northeastern University and earning a master&rsquo;s degree in business administration from Boston University, he spent his career working in health care finance, Benn said. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a total product of the private sector,&rdquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Benn said he views government from the perspectives of a parent, student, taxpayer, and someone who has worked in business for 24 years.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;These are the customers of government, and the customer should always be right,&rdquo; he said, adding that state government has lost sight of this.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Benn said the primary reason he&rsquo;s running is to get those who are &ldquo;stuck in the unemployment cycle&rdquo; back to work and to boost the economy. <span>&ldquo;These are real people with real needs who need good food on their plate and a good roof over their head,&rdquo; he said.</span>
    
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Bringing the state income tax rate and sales tax back down to 5 percent is a good starting point in restoring a thriving state economy, he said.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>He emphasized that he does not advocate for a lower tax rate to simply &ldquo;put a few more dollars in my pocket,&rdquo; but to provide the economic stimulus necessary for small businesses to thrive and create jobs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Many people who live near the New Hampshire border, and many from the 14th Middlesex District, drive over the state line to avoid the 6&frac14; percent sales tax in Massachusetts.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;When that happens, the state loses revenue from the whole sale,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Businesses lose sales and unemployment goes up.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The second thing on Benn&rsquo;s economic agenda is to get spending under control.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Legislators should take the same approach to creating a budget as people in the private sector, which is to start at zero and require those requesting funds to justify each dollar being asked for, Benn said. 
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;We all maybe do more than we would have liked to do with less money than we would have liked to do it with,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But the job gets done.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Benn said if legislators worked together on Beacon Hill as well as individuals do in the private sector, things in government would get done more efficiently. &ldquo;But some people are doing things for their own political gain,&rdquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Atkins, who was first elected to Beacon Hill in a special election in 1999, said the state&rsquo;s economy is a lot better than in many parts of the country.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;Our bond rating is double A plus, one of only three states with that rating, we are ranked first in education .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and our rainy day fund is over $1 billion,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That gives us a real advantage in attracting business and creating jobs.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Atkins said that while the state has an innovative economy, it also has a cold climate, which can be a turnoff for companies looking for a place to locate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;But what attracts businesses here is our quality of life and our education system,&rdquo; she said.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>She said legislation passed during the last session, including health care cost containment, a jobs bill, and a move to streamline the permitting process for companies to build here, will help spur growth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>But another key issue, Atkins said, is public transportation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>She said the approximately $20 billion deficit in that department is something that can no longer be pushed aside, and balancing the budget &ldquo;is going to take a large, dedicated revenue stream.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>She said her first priority will be to make sure the concerns of the people in her district are represented, but that she is not ruling out voting in favor of a tax increase or new revenue stream that would specifically be used to balance the transportation budget.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a grown-up,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Santa Claus is not going to appear and fix this. I wish he were, but we are going to have to fix this and we are going to have to pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Another thing Atkins says needs fixing is campaign finance laws that allow companies to pour unlimited amounts of money directly into political advertisements.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="">
    <p>Atkins sponsored legislation calling for lawmakers in Washington to respond to a US Supreme Court ruling that allows for the unfettered corporate contributions.

    <p>SOMERVILLE &mdash; These are the dog days for Somerville High football.</p>
    <p>The team is struggling along with an 0-7 record and prospects don&rsquo;t look good with No. 2 Everett on the horizon for this weekend. There is ample opportunity for senior lineman Ryan Conte to become a clubhouse cancer and bemoan his fate while others throughout the commonwealth are enjoying their moments in the spotlight.</p>
    <p>But that wouldn&rsquo;t be Conte. The 6-foot-4, 250-pounder arrives at practice 20-30 minutes early every day and remains the hardest worker in the program.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very dedicated, worked out twice daily in the offseason to become a better player,&rdquo; said Somerville coach Tony Gulla, who returned to coach the Highlanders after spending the past eight seasons as an assistant at Olympia High in Orlando, Florida. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a leader and does everything we ask of him.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>A lifelong resident of Somerville, Conte was talked into playing football by John Wallace. A fellow lineman who earned a scholarship to UMass, Conte credits Wallace with making him the player he is today.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Me and John are really good friends going all the way back to hockey, and he&rsquo;s the one who convinced me to play football,&rdquo; Conte said. &ldquo;We still talk all the time. He tells me to be cool, be patient and work hard because good things will happen to me.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Wallace speaks from experience. Like Conte, he experienced very little success in terms of wins and losses, but his skills were too hard to overlook as evidenced by the scholarship. Gulla has coached his share of quality linemen in nearly 25 years, and says Conte could be the second best lineman he&rsquo;s coached behind Gosder Cherilus, now starting for the Detroit Lions.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to say he&rsquo;s as good as Gosder,&rdquo; Gulla said, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s as good as anyone else I&rsquo;ve had. When I was coaching in Florida, we had a lineman (Shawn Curtis) who has 20 Division 1 offers right now, and I&rsquo;d put Ryan right there with him. He does everything you want an offensive lineman to do &mdash; finishes his blocks, gets right up on them and pancakes them.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Some lucky program is going to get a diamond in the rough.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Conte received some interest from UMass and UNH along with some of the Ivy League schools. Conte knows full well that the interest might have been greater if he played elsewhere, but he wouldn&rsquo;t trade his high school experience for anything, regardless of overall records.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;This is my home. I grew up in Somerville and always wanted to play for Somerville High School,&rdquo; Conte said. &ldquo;I want to keep playing hard, trying to motivate everyone to keep pushing for that first win.&rdquo;</p>

    </p><p><em>The following letter was send to parents on Oct. 31 by Superintendent Anne Wilson:</em></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Dear SPS Parents and Guardians:</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>I am happy to report that school will be open tomorrow, November 1,  2012. Please be aware that there continue to be blocked roads and  hazards in certain areas around Sudbury. Currently Town Internet is not  working due to a fallen tree near the Flynn building and therefore an  update on closed roads is not available online. Work to repair the fiber  lines was in process today and will continue tomorrow.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>As  of this evening, NSTAR is still working on problem areas and Sudbury  Fire/Police Department personnel have informed us that the area around  each individual school is clear but that the following problem areas  exist:</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Peakham Road from French to Southwest Circle (Crews were working on this area this evening)</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ul><li>French Road from Peakham to Red Horse Path</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Dudley Road from Tippling Road to Nobscott</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>The area around Thunder Road, Sunset, and Silver Hill</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>The area around Candy Hill and Plympton Road</li>&#13;\n\
    </ul><p>Please  remind your children to observe all yellow caution tape areas and be  aware that hazards may still exist, especially in the areas described in  this message.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>We  anticipate that bus service may be delayed somewhat due to the  necessity for alternate paths to bus stops. The SPS central office  phones and Internet access were not in service this evening due to the  work on the damaged fiber lines at Flynn. We hope that repairs will be  final tomorrow.\xC2\xA0<strong>If you experience a problem with bus service tomorrow, please call the SPS bus lot at <a>978-443-8631</a>.</strong>\xC2\xA0The  bus company has assured us that they expect to be able to make all  stops, but with potential delays in problem areas that may still exist  in he morning.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Thank  you for your patience and your understanding that we have been working  hard to ensure student safety and bring you the most current  information.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Anne S. Wilson,<br>Superintendent of Schools</p>\n\

    </p><p>By J. Pierre Sasson M.D. Mount Auburn Hospital</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the breakthrough  advancements in technology that is helping combat breast cancer today.  Breast MRI is a highly sensitive, noninvasive diagnostic tool that is  used in conjunction with mammography and ultrasound to detect, diagnose  and monitor breast cancer therapies.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Every woman is at risk for breast cancer and that is why most women  have yearly mammograms beginning at the age of 40. For some women who  are at higher risk, doctors recommend alternating a breast MRI and  mammography every six months to help detect early stage breast cancer.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The MRI machine uses alternating magnetic gradients in combination  with radio waves to image anatomy in detail. Before getting a breast  MRI, the patient is asked a series of questions to make sure it is safe  for her to go into the magnetic field. During the 30 minute scan, the  MRI unit is able to take pictures and halfway through the scan, the MRI  technologist injects contrast into the patient\xE2\x80\x99s vein. The patient is  then re-imaged to record the contrast as it moves through the breast  tissue. The contrast allows the imaging machine to see tissues that  receives a lot of blood flow, which can help determine if the tissue is  cancerous.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Breast MRI is also useful for evaluating women recently diagnosed  with breast cancer. Not only can a breast MRI detect the local extent of  tumor, it can also find other locations of cancer in the same or  opposite breast that may otherwise go undetected. If we detect an  abnormality with a breast MRI that is not visible from the other  diagnostic techniques, we can perform an MRI-guided biopsy, if needed.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Women should have a breast MRI in conjunction with a mammogram if  they have a 20 \xE2\x80\x93 25% greater lifetime risk for developing breast cancer.  These include: women who are a 1<sup>st</sup>-degree relative of  someone with the breast cancer gene and women who had radiation to their  chests between ages 10-30. Being that October is National Breast Cancer  Awareness Month we urge you to schedule your mammogram and talk to your  doctor to see if you are a candidate for breast MRI.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong><i>J. Pierre Sasson, M.D. </i></strong><i>is the</i><i> </i><i>Vice  Chair of Mount Auburn Hospital\xE2\x80\x99s Department of Radiology and the  Director of MRI Services.

The centerpiece of Brown\xE2\x80\x99s healthcare  policy is working to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the federal healthcare reform law known as ObamaCare.</p><p>National healthcare advocacy organization Community Catalyst Action  Fund released a new analysis finding that, if the Affordable Care Act  (\xE2\x80\x9CObamaCare\xE2\x80\x9D) is repealed, senior citizens in Sudbury and across  Massachusetts will be saddled with higher costs and fewer benefits.</p><p>ObamaCare, as it is known, lowers seniors\xE2\x80\x99 Medicare premiums and  out-of-pocket costs by an estimated $500 per year. This means that, if  Republican Scott Brown gets his way and repeals ObamaCare, seniors\xE2\x80\x99  Medicare costs will go up about $5,000 over the next decade.</p><p>ObamaCare also fills in the so-called \xE2\x80\x9Cdonut hole\xE2\x80\x9D in prescription  drug coverage for seniors.\xC2\xA0 Between January and August of this year,  31,000 Massachusetts residents hit the \xE2\x80\x9Cdonut hole.\xE2\x80\x9D\xC2\xA0 ObamaCare saved  those Medicare beneficiaries an average of over $600 per person.\xC2\xA0 This  means that, if Republican Scott Brown gets his way and repeals  ObamaCare, seniors\xE2\x80\x99 prescription drug costs will go up dramatically.</p><p>Also, during the first eight months of 2012, over 500,000 Medicare  beneficiaries across Massachusetts took advantage of no-cost preventive  services thanks to ObamaCare. If Republican Scott Brown gets his way  and repeals ObamaCare, seniors will lose these no-cost preventive  services.</p><p>Policy decisions made in Washington, D.C., have a real and direct  impact on the residents of Sudbury. The healthcare policy that  Republican Scott Brown is advocating would have a decidedly harmful  impact on Sudbury's seniors.</p><p><em>Mathew Helman</em><br><em>ProgressMass</em><br></p>\n\

    <p>Since today is Halloween, there's no better topic to turn to than ... candy.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>I inherited a sweet tooth from both my grandmothers. Nana always had a white porcelain candy jar in her hutch, and a glass bowl on the coffee table, hiding treats like mini Reese's cups or dark chocolates. Grandma loved hard candies \xE2\x80\x94 suckers \xE2\x80\x94 but also had a tin of Snickers, Milky Way and other chocolate treats on hand.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>So today I thank both of them for my love of candy!</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>As a kid, trick-or-treating was exciting and fun, but perhaps the best part was getting home after and sitting at the kitchen table with my sister to sort and count our bounty. There were trades made, raisins given to my mom and tins stacked with mini candy bars to be rationed out over the coming weeks.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>It's hard to pick just five favorite Halloween trick-or-treat staples, but here goes:</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ul><li><strong>M&amp;Ms: </strong>Always a favorite of mine. I love peanut M&amp;Ms, but due to their size, there are fewer than in a fun sized pack of plain M&amp;Ms. But I've never seen an M&amp;M I don't like, especially with all the fun flavors now made.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>Candy corn:</strong> I like biting off each colored layer, starting with the white tip, and making my way down the kernel. The candy corns that end with a chocolate layer are wonderful, and I'm also quite fond of the pumpkins.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>Snickers: </strong>A classic. Chocolate, nougat, peanuts, caramel. What's not to love? </li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>Crunch:</strong> I wasn't always a fan of these when I was younger, but came around to the delicious chocolate and crisp rice combo later in life. </li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>Charleston Chew:</strong> These were a staple of my Halloween bags of yore. Chewy and elastic provided for a fun eating experience. And frozen Charleston Chews are a pleasant treat as well. </li>&#13;\n\
    </ul><p>I still need to hit the store to buy candy to hand out. Bought any earlier in the week or month, Halloween candy would stand no chance of making it to Oct. 31. There's still a chance it won't make it to 6 p.m. If you're still needing to pick up candy, I bet <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwayland.patch.com%2flistings%2fcvs-125\">CVS</a> or <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwayland.patch.com%2flistings%2fdonelans-supermarket\">Donelan's</a> still has a supply left.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CSince 2000, we\xE2\x80\x99ve provided over 320 bulletproof vests, including twenty SWAT K9 vests at $2400 each, across the state.\xC2\xA0 With our expanded mission, we\xE2\x80\x99ve been able to offer more support for K9 programs, with over $35,000 in grants to local police and county sheriff departments, as well as the Massachusetts State Police, providing K-9 first aid kits, cruiser kennels, HOTnPOP (cruiser over-heat-detector/alarm and door-popper systems) and bite sleeves/suits.\xC2\xA0 We provided a grant to help fund a K9 training conference attended by 65 handlers, and awarded $12,500 to help implement K9 programs in Blackstone, Douglas, Holliston, Salem, and Marlboro.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>All proceeds remain in-state, solely supporting Massachusetts K9 programs.\xC2\xA0 The organization is a 501(c)3 non-profit; donations are tax-deductible as allowed by the IRS.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Diane Whittaker, Vice President of Massachusetts Vest-a-Dog explains, \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s exciting to be able to extend our support for our 4-legged officers.\xC2\xA0 For example, we\xE2\x80\x99re glad to have provided another tool to help insure the safety of a K-9; a HOTnPOP system for a K9 cruiser, after learning the cruiser\xE2\x80\x99s radiator hose had failed \xE2\x80\x93 causing the engine to blow hot air, instead of air-conditioned-cooled air on a hot day, a potentially fatal situation.\xC2\xA0 Now if the interior temperature exceeds an acceptable level, the cruiser\xE2\x80\x99s lights and horn are activated, windows roll down, and the beeper worn on the handler\xE2\x80\x99s duty belt will activate, as well.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CThese dogs are a vital necessity to law enforcement, keeping our communities safe, bringing home lost family members, tracking/apprehending suspects, sniffing out drugs, locating evidence on a track, and more.\xC2\xA0 They clearly love their job.\xC2\xA0 It\xE2\x80\x99s an honor and joy to volunteer with Massachusetts Vest-a-Dog, as it\xE2\x80\x99s given me more opportunities to help these outstanding police dogs,\xE2\x80\x9D\xC2\xA0 affirms Whittaker, a Certified Veterinary Technician for 26-plus years (20 at New England Animal Medical Center in West Bridgewater).</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Also featured in the Massachusetts Vest-a-Dog 2013 calendars are K-9 teams from Ashland, Westford, Newton and Barnstable Police Departments, Essex County Sheriff\xE2\x80\x99s Department, Massachusetts State Police and Veterans Administration-Bedford. Besides calendars, other merchandise is also available on the website:\xC2\xA0 Tshirts, hats, dog tags, travel mugs and window decals.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Donations may be sent directly to Massachusetts Vest-a-Dog, Inc, PO BOX 48 Walpole MA\xC2\xA0 02081.\xC2\xA0 For more information, please call 508-668-7149 or visit their website at www.mavestadog.org</p></div></div>"
  summary: "Massachusetts Vest-a-Dog 2013 Calendar is now available for a $10 donation, online and at select locations including Especially for Pets at 44 Main ST, Wayland.\xC2\xA0 Proceeds from the calendars will support Massachusetts police dogs, by helping provide bulletproof vests, essential equipment, and funding"

    </p><p>The Obama campaign won the most expensive presidential race ever, with both parties raising about $2.6 billion. The race was filled with negative campaigning on both sides, from President Obama attacking Romney\xE2\x80\x99s business experience with Bain Capital to Romney lambasting Obama\xE2\x80\x99s handling of the economy.</p><p>The race tightened during the final months of the campaign, with gaffes and surges from both candidates. After a weak performance after the Republican Convention, Romney surged following Obama\xE2\x80\x99s listless performance after the first presidential debate. Nevertheless, the president cemented a lead in battleground states heading into Tuesday\xE2\x80\x99s election.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In his concession speech from Boston, Romney wished Obama well.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><h2>Patch Poll: And the winner is...</h2><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>So who is going to win Ohio? A Patch survey of Democratic and Republican influencers in Northeast Ohio show that while survey respondents in each party think their candidate has a better shot to win the state, Democrats appear to be more confident in Obama than Republicans are in Romney.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Influencers submitted their survey answers between Oct. 31 and Nov. 5. The survey was answered by 23 Democrats and 32 Republicans. The poll is part of Patch's <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fsolon.patch.com%2farticles%2felection-2012-introducing-red-blue-northeast-ohio\">Red/Blue Northeast Ohio</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Democrats believe Obama has run a better campaign -- both on the ground and across the airwaves -- than Romney. Of the 23 respondents, only one believes Romney will defeat Obama.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"President Obama has been a steady leader and deserved another term to finish what he started,\" one Democrat responded.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>GOP influencers surveyed offer a different perspective. They say Romney ran the better campaign and that he will win Ohio. But Republicans aren't as confident: Of the 30 who answered the question, 24 believe Romney will win and six say Obama will claim victory in the Buckeye State.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Still, Republicans believe conservatives will come out and vote.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"At this stage voter turnout is critical and Republicans are very motivated to vote this year,\" wrote a GOP survey respondent.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Both Republicans and Democrats agree on one thing: They will be glad when it's over.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Glad to see it come to an end!\" wrote a Republican.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"A welcome end to a daily example of the worst of us,\" said a Democrat.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><h2>Ohio: The Ultimate Swing State</h2><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Ohio has earned its reputation as a swing state that decides presidential elections, and has picked the winner since at least 1988, selecting both Republicans and Democrats.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In 2008, Ohio voted Democratic with more than 2,940,044 voters casting ballots for the Obama-Biden team. Republicans John McCain and Sarah Palin earned 2,677,820 votes. According to statistics collected by the Ohio Secretary of the State's office, voter turnout tallied about 70 percent in 2008.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Before that, Ohio went to George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004, and Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996. George H.W. Bush was Ohio's pick in 1988.</p>\n\

  content: "<div><div>\n\
    <p>Ohio voters are heading to the polls today in droves under sunny, blue skies and there are essentially no Election Day problems being reported in five Ohio counties that are home to Patch websites.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>Stark County</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Jeanette Mullane, deputy director of the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boe.co.stark.oh.us%2f\">Stark County Board of Elections</a>, said all 160 polling locations in the county opened on time this morning and have seen a steady stream of electors.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s been consistent voting all morning, which is what\xE2\x80\x99s expected during a presidential election year,\xE2\x80\x9D she said.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Stark County\xE2\x80\x99s touch-screen voting machines are all operational and ready for use, said Mullane. But even if some weren\xE2\x80\x99t, it wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t be an issue for long.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CSometimes the machines get paper jams or other things that can be taken care of by our Election Day technicians. They troubleshoot all day long and are available to respond to any problems that may occur,\xE2\x80\x9D she explained.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Mullane issued a reminder that Ohio polls close at 7:30 p.m. today. \xE2\x80\x9CAnyone in line at 7:30 is permitted to vote. If they show up at 7:32, it\xE2\x80\x99s too late,\xE2\x80\x9D she said.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>Portage County</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Faith Lyon, director of the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.co.portage.oh.us%2felection%2findex.html\">Portage County Board of Elections</a>, said voting is strong and that she\xE2\x80\x99s happy about today\xE2\x80\x99s sunny skies.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CI think we\xE2\x80\x99re looking really good. If the phone calls are any indication we\xE2\x80\x99re going to have a great voter turnout today,\xE2\x80\x9D Lyon said. \xE2\x80\x9CWhen the weather conditions are good, folks aren\xE2\x80\x99t afraid to get out and vote.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>She said all of Portage County\xE2\x80\x99s 131 polling locations opened on time this morning and have not been experiencing problems with their touch-screen voting machines.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>For an optimum election experience, Lyon suggested that voters know their ward and precinct before heading out to vote. That information is available on board of elections websites throughout the state.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Once voters arrive at their polling location, they should have their identification ready to present and be prepared to vote.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CIf they\xE2\x80\x99re not familiar with what\xE2\x80\x99s on the ballot they can take look at a copy of the actual ballot \xE2\x80\x93 available at each polling location \xE2\x80\x93 beforehand so when they head into the voting booth they have an idea in their minds as to how they\xE2\x80\x99re going to vote,\xE2\x80\x9D Lyon explained.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>She also issued a reminder that voters statewide who requested and received an absentee ballot but didn\xE2\x80\x99t return it before today cannot vote at their designated polling location.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Instead, Lyon said, \xE2\x80\x9CThey need to fill (the absentee ballot) in and must return it in person to the board of elections office today or vote a provisional, or paper, ballot at their usual polling location.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>Cuyahoga County</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Mike West, media and voter education specialist at the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboe.cuyahogacounty.us%2f\">Cuyahoga County Board of Elections</a>, said he\xE2\x80\x99s heard of lines at some of the county\xE2\x80\x99s 423 polling locations, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut not excessive lines.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CWe did an unofficial turnout survey from some locations chosen at random. Our in-house numbers have turnout at about 13 percent so far today,\xE2\x80\x9D West said. \xE2\x80\x9COur website has an election profile (that) shows statistics from the last presidential election in November 2008,\xE2\x80\x9D when voter turnout was 61 percent.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>All county polling locations opened on time today and none have experienced any major problems with their paper optical scan ballots.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CWe\xE2\x80\x99ve heard that there\xE2\x80\x99s some (machines) that have jammed, but we get those repaired rapidly. Also, voting isn\xE2\x80\x99t interrupted because of the scan. Voters can still cast a ballot a put it in a ballot box,\xE2\x80\x9D West said.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>Lorain County</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Voter turnout has been running high this morning in Lorain County, according to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.loraincountyelections.com%2f\">Board of Elections</a> Director Paul Adams.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9COur early voting for both mail and in office has been much higher (than usual),\xE2\x80\x9D Adams said. \xE2\x80\x9CI have received a number of reports of large turnout in some places in the county. There are some places where people are taking a little bit longer time to vote, particularly Elyria because of the large number of charter issues on the ballot.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>All 78 Lorain County polling locations opened on time this morning and have not experienced any major problems with their touch-screen voting systems.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>Lake County</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Scott Daisher, director of the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.lakeelections.com%2f\">Lake County Board of Elections</a>, said there\xE2\x80\x99s been a \xE2\x80\x9Cvery steady\xE2\x80\x9D stream of voters this morning, comparable to the 2008 presidential election, and that he doesn\xE2\x80\x99t think the weather plays a role.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CIn this type of election it wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t matter what the weather was,\xE2\x80\x9D he said.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Workers in Lake County\xE2\x80\x99s 80 polling locations serving 157 precincts all showed up and were open for business by 7:30 this morning.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The only touch-screen voting machine problem Daisher is aware of was quickly resolved. \xE2\x80\x9CWe had one (machine) that fell, but it was put back up on its legs and is running again,\xE2\x80\x9D he explained.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Summit County</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"It's as busy as I've ever seen it on Election Day,\" said Summit County Board of Election Presiding Judge John Ross at Cuyahoga Falls' Quirk Cultural Center early Tuesday morning.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>It's  been said it's far better to have a neighbor who's near, than a  brother who's far away, but in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, Americans  across the nation have proven to be the best neighbors and the strongest  of  families.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>This  past weekend, AOL and Patch employees took an opportunity to pitch in, packing two tractor  trailers worth of food, water and supplies in Dulles, VA, and Baltimore.  The donations are headed to Hurricane Sandy ravaged areas in New Jersey  and Long Island.</p><p>&#13;
    &#13;
    </p><p>"When  a catastrophe of this size hits, we all feel it, both the hundreds of  us who live in the impacted towns, and our colleagues who are watching  and wishing they could help more. So for us AOLers and Patchers, it  feels like a relief and a privilege to get to help out in such a big,  immediate way," said Patch Chief Content Officer Rachel Fishman Feddersen.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>The AOL trucks will arrive in New Jersey on Monday and Long Island the next day. The  deliveries will include many of the essentials residents most need,  such as bottled water, blankets, batteries, canned soup, disposable  diapers, baby formula and more.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>The  trucks are rolling as residents in areas such as the Jersey Shore,  Staten Island and Long Island are still coping with the aftermath of the  hurricane. Hundreds of thousands are still without power, the area  transit systems are crippled, and gas lines can go on for miles, as  motorists desperately try to fill their cars and residents look to fill  gas cans in order to keep generators humming in near-freezing  temperatures.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>You can join us in the relief efforts.</p><p>&#13;

  content: "<div><div><p>On Weds., November 14, from 7:00 - 9:00pm, <strong>NESCA</strong> Founder and Director <strong>Ann Helmus, Ph.D. </strong>will discuss the \"nuts and bolts\" of neuropsychological evaluation:</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ul><li>What exactly is a neuropsych evaluation?</li>&#13;\n\
    <li> Why would you have your child evaluated, and when?</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>How do you choose someone to evaluate your child?</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>How does an experienced neuropsychologist drill down into your child's \"symptoms\" (attention deficits, executive function weaknesses, etc.), to fully understand what's likely going on in his/her brain, and explain that to you clearly?</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><i>And, then, how can YOU use this enhanced knowledge to improve your child's ability to learn?</i> </li>&#13;\n\
    </ul><p><br> She will also focus on the written report and what you're entitled to expect of it: timely delivery, insightfully integrated data, a recognizable portrait of your whole child, and a set of specific recommendations easily understood and implemented by all concerned.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>When: </b>Wednesday, November 14th, 7:00 \xE2\x80\x93 9:00pm</p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (CBS/AP) &#8211; Republican Ovide Lamontagne has conceded in the New Hampshire governor&#8217;s race and is wishing Democratic winner Maggie Hassan well.</p>\n\
    <p>He says he expected personal attacks but was surprised at the influence of outside third parties &#8220;demonizing&#8221; him.</p>\n\
    <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not going to be our night,&#8221; Lamontagne said.</p>\n\
    <p>Hassan, a former state Senate majority leader, will keep New Hampshire governor&#8217;s seat in Democratic control. She had argued Lamontagne was too extreme for New Hampshire.</p>\n\
    <p>Hassan succeeds John Lynch, who has been governor since 2005. He has served four two-year terms and is retiring.</p>\n\
    <p>Hassan&#8217;s campaign stressed the need to repair damage done by the Republican Legislature in its last budget, particularly by restoring deep cuts to public colleges and the state&#8217;s hospitals.</p>\n\
    <p>Lamontagne said tonight his biggest regret is that New Hampshire will lose out on a wonderful first lady in his wife Bettie.</p>\n\

  content: "<div><div><p>Marie Gooding Eaton, 90, died peacefully in her home, with her two sons by her side, on Wednesday, October 31, 2012. Born in Boston on August 5, 1922, she was the<br>daughter of the late Frederic Gooding (originally of Portsmouth, New Hampshire) and Julia Papin Gooding (originally of St. Louis, Missouri). She was the wife of the late John Marshall Eaton, Jr., who died in 1997.</p><p>Mrs. Eaton lived in Cambridge until she moved to Concord with her family in 1925, commencing a life-long association with Concord Academy. She first lived in Lee House, before her parents purchased what is now known as Aloian House,<br>at 64 Main Street, in 1928. When she walked out the back door each morning, she was at school. Mrs. Eaton told the Concord Oral History Program in 2003 that her \xE2\x80\x9Clife growing up centered around Concord Academy which over the years grew up around our house. I went there from kindergarten through 12th grade. I made good friends there and many of them are still my best friends.\xE2\x80\x9D She was<br>affectionately known to her \xE2\x80\x9CCA\xE2\x80\x9D friends as \xE2\x80\x9CPudding\xE2\x80\x9D. It was at the Academy that her love for the British monarchy first became evident \xE2\x80\x93 her yearbook page reported that \xE2\x80\x9CIf anyone wants to know what the British Queen wore on May 11,1939 we suggest consulting Pudding.\xE2\x80\x9D She graduated from Concord Academy in 1940. In 1999, she co-authored The Story of the Concord Academy Houses, so that<br>the \xE2\x80\x9Cgirls who came from other parts of the country\xE2\x80\x9D would know the history of the Academy buildings. </p><p>Upon graduating from Concord Academy, Mrs. Eaton attended the Miss Amy M. Sacker School of Decorative Design and the Pierce Secretarial School, both in<br>Boston. She then went to work for the British Naval Mission in Boston, which supplied troops for the ships that America was building to help the British in their fight against Nazi Germany. \xE2\x80\x9CIt was a very exciting job,\xE2\x80\x9D she said, \xE2\x80\x9Cand<br>made rationing seem like no hardship.\xE2\x80\x9D Her work for the Mission cemented her love for England, and led to her frequent travels there the rest of her life.After the War, Mrs. Eaton worked as a secretary for the renowned architect, Walter Gropius.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><br>Mrs. Eaton knew her future husband from an early age as their parents were good friends, but John Eaton was more than four years her senior. She enjoyed telling her family that on their first date in 1943, Mr. Eaton took her dancing<br>on the Ritz Roof in Boston when he was home on leave during World War II. Rekindling their romance after the War, they were engaged over Leif Nash\xE2\x80\x99s bar in the old Dovre Ski Binding factory in West Concord, and they were married in Rye Beach, New Hampshire in 1950.</p><p>Mrs. Eaton was a long-time member and supporter of the Concord Independent Battery, and remembered her childhood days when she was awakened in the early<br>morning darkness by the clatter of horses and gun carriages parading past her Main Street home as the Battery headed for Nashawtuc Hill to fire its Dawn<br>Salute on Patriot\xE2\x80\x99s Day. In the \xE2\x80\x9840s, \xE2\x80\x9850s and \xE2\x80\x9860s, she frequently appeared in productions by the Concord Players. She was especially proud of her 1952 role as Beth in Louisa May Alcott\xE2\x80\x99s Little Women. She was a member of the Concord Country Club for most of her life, where she was often seen either on the golf course or having fun with her friends; she was also a member of the Ladies\xE2\x80\x99 Tuesday Club. Over the years, she volunteered at the Orchard House, the Concord Antiquarian Society, the Concord Free Public Library, \xC2\xA0Concord Academy, and the Moffatt-Ladd<br>House in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. From 1970 to 1990, \xE2\x80\x9Cafter the kids were out of the house\xE2\x80\x9D, Mrs. Eaton worked at the Stationers, Inc., a new Concord business started by her friends. </p><p>Mrs. Eaton also loved to travel, and it was there that her adventurous side showed through. That spirit was more apparent than ever in the summer of 1964 when she loaded up the family station wagon and drove her young sons and nephews across America to meet up with John, who was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in San Francisco. That trip remains today the subject of great, and often embellished, stories among the cousins. Mrs. Eaton also overcame her fear of flying, with an assist from Jim Beam, to make frequent trips to Europe, especially to the British Isles, to Bermuda and to<br>the Caribbean, always with family or friends.</p><p>Mrs. Eaton was proud of her family heritage, both on her mother\xE2\x80\x99s side, which traces back to St. Louis founder Auguste Chouteau, and on her father\xE2\x80\x99s side,<br>where her grandfather was the pastor of the South Parish Unitarian Church in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. She also reveled in the history of Concord, whether it was about its Revolutionary War past, its literary age, or the history of<br>her lifetime. If she was in Town, she never missed the Patriot\xE2\x80\x99s Day parade. Even at age 88, she had a roadside seat for the parade, cheering on the Concord Minutemen, the Battery, and the Fenn School Marching Band. But her pride never got in the way of her sense of humor \xE2\x80\x93 she once raised the Union Jack, a gift from the British Mission, atop the flag pole in Concord Center in the early<br>morning hours one April 19th, just to see the look on the faces of proper Concordians.</p><p>Mrs. Eaton also cherished spending summers in Rye Beach, New Hampshire where the family had a house, a few minutes\xE2\x80\x99 walk from the Atlantic Ocean, until 1984. Rye was a special place for family and friends, where she recharged her batteries by walking on the beach, swimming in the ocean, collecting \xE2\x80\x9Cjewel money\xE2\x80\x9D, and socializing at The Beach Club. </p><p>Mrs. Eaton leaves two sons, Edward H. of Kensington, New Hampshire, and Robert G. of Rye, New Hampshire; a brother, Frederic Gooding, Jr. of Madison, Wisconsin; a sister, Eleanor Gooding Hallowell of Stamford, Connecticut; and four grandchildren \xE2\x80\x93 Julia, Kerry and David Eaton of Rye, New Hampshire, and Timothy Eaton of Kensington, New Hampshire.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><br>A funeral Mass will be held on Saturday, November 10, 2012, at Holy Family Parish, Monument Square, Concord Center, at 1:30 p.m. Burial following the Mass<br>will be in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Concord, where the Concord Independent Battery will present a final salute to Mrs. Eaton. </p><p>Visiting hours will be held at the Dee Funeral Home, 27 Bedford Street, Concord Center on Friday, November 9th, from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. </p><p>In lieu of flowers, contributions in Mrs. Eaton\xE2\x80\x99s memory may be made to Emerson Hospital, 133 Old Road to Nine Acre Corner, Concord, MA 01742(<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.emersonhospital.org\">www.emersonhospital.org</a>) or to Concord Academy, 166 Main Street, Concord, MA 01742 (<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.concordacademy.org\">www.concordacademy.org</a>).</p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>MANCHESTER, NH (CBS) &#8211; Fresh from their final debate, the two candidates for governor of New Hampshire were back on the campaign trail Friday.</p>
    <p>Ovide Lamontagne, the Republican, walked the streets of Manchester and visited with customers at different restaurants.</p>
    <p>&#8220;New Hampshire&#8217;s economy has been lagging and stagnant and we need to jump start this economy,&#8221; said Lamontagne. &#8220;And that means reforming state government and balancing the budget without raising taxes.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Democrat Maggie Hassan&#8217;s campaign stops Friday included a women&#8217;s rally in Concord where she touted her plan for the economy.</p>
    <p>&#8220;It is a plan that makes sure we are going to be innovative and a business-friendly state, it provides tax credits to businesses&#8230;without an income or sales tax,&#8221; said Hassan.</p>
    <p>Political analyst Scott Spradling says the race for governor is unique this time around because there are so many undecided voters this close to election day.</p>
    <p>He says Hassan, a former state senate majority leader, has had trouble reaching voters.</p>
    <p>&#8220;I think she&#8217;s struggled to make that personal connection,&#8221; says Spradling.</p>
    <p>As for Lamontagne, Spradling wonders if this time he can seal the deal.</p>
    <p>&#8220;He&#8217;s run for Senate, he ran for governor back in 1996, he&#8217;s never won anything before,&#8221; says Spradling.</p>
    <p>Most polls show the race to be a dead heat.

  content: "<div><div><p>Concord -- Michael Benn is pleased to announce that he has earned the endorsement of a true American hero; Concord's own Captain Thomas Hudner.\xC2\xA0 Captain Hudner was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his brave, unselfish, and heroic actions on December 4, 1950 when he intentionally crash-landed his aircraft on a snowy mountain near the Chosin Reservoir in Korea, in an attempt to save the life of fellow airman, Ensign Jesse Brown, the first African-American aviator in the US Navy.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"I've known Captain Hudner for many years and have always felt humbled in his presence and proud to call him a friend\" said Benn, candidate for State Representative in the Fourteenth Middlesex District.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>For his part, Mr. Hudner feels that the district, and the Commonwealth need the common-sense leadership that they will get from Benn, who has spent 24 years in the private-sector, in the field of healthcare finance. \"He has the background in finance and economics to really start<br>to turn things around\" said Hudner, referring to the dismal economic outlook and growing unemployment numbers.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The unemployment rate in Massachusetts has been growing for months and reached 6.5% in September.\xC2\xA0 This represents 225,000 men and women; white, black, and hispanic; young, and middle-aged; our relatives, friends and neighbors.\xC2\xA0 These people need to put food on the table and roofs over their heads, they do not need to pay more for gasoline and everyday necessities.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Michael Benn is a candidate for State Representative of<br>Massachusetts Fourteenth Middlesex District which includes the towns of Concord, Carlisle, Acton (precincts 1, 2, and 6), and Chelmsford (precincts 1 and 9).\xC2\xA0 He is a lifelong resident of Concord with a BS from Northeastern University, and an MBA from Boston University.\xC2\xA0 He has worked in the private sector, in the field of healthcare finance for the past 24 years.\xC2\xA0 Mr. Benn is running for this seat because his real-world problem-solving experience is needed on Beacon Hill now, more than ever.\xC2\xA0 He will approach every problem from the perspective of the taxpayer, student, and parent, not as a government bureaucrat.\xC2\xA0 Michael Benn has the skills necessary to be<br>an exceptional Legislator, one of whom we can be proud.</p></div></div>"

    </p><p><b>Braintree, MA</b> <b>(November 1, 2012)</b>\xC2\xA0 Massachusetts<br>entrepreneur Adam Goldberg, M.Ed., recently previewed his new technology solution, designed to help parents of the more than 19 million children with Autism, ADHD, Learning Disabilities or other exceptional needs, at the<br>Democratic and Republican national conventions.\xC2\xA0 The response from delegates, the media and advocates was phenomenal and last month, Goldberg was invited to The White House to showcase <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.myEdGPS.com\">www.myEdGPS.com</a>, the first-of-its-kind online navigation platform for parents of struggling<br>students.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Goldberg is currently seeking beta testers for myEdGPS and plans to use the feedback from the parent trials<br>to further enhance a product that will make it easier for parents to help their child succeed in school. myEdGPS is scheduled to launch in February, 2013.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Navigating the special education process can be a daunting, frustrating and costly experience for parents who often can\xE2\x80\x99t find the information and resources they need at the time they need them.\xC2\xA0 Parents of struggling students often complain they are stymied by the process of evaluating, then planning out the most effective and well-suited educational direction for their child.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"As an education advisor for more than 15 years, I grew frustrated turning away 95% of the calls from people who needed help for their child but couldn't afford it,\" said<br>Goldberg.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The resources parents can access using this platform take students from preschool, right up through their college years, thereby providing long-term direction, not just short-term solutions.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>Wesleyan succeeds with local players
    </p>
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Former rivals in the Dual County League, Acton-Boxborough Regional grad <strong>Kevin Hughes </strong>and Concord-Carlisle High products <strong>Dan &shy;D&rsquo;Arcy
    </strong>&nbsp;and <strong>&shy;Peter George
    </strong> are contributing to the best football season at Wesleyan University since 2002.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Wesleyan, 5-2 in the New England Small College Athletic Conference, hosts undefeated (7-0) league rival Trinity College on Saturday.  A victory in the season finale would enable the Cardinals to match the six-win season of the 1998 squad.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;This season has been a turning point for our program,&rdquo; said Hughes, a 6-foot-4, 240-pound junior who is also joined on the roster by senior tackle <strong>Jim Curley</strong>,&nbsp;a graduate of St. Sebastian&rsquo;s School in Needham, and sophomore backup defensive lineman <strong>Zach Bartlett
    </strong>&nbsp;of Norfolk. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re learning how to win, and hopefully we&rsquo;re moving in the right direction.&rdquo; </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Lining up as an H-back and tight end, Hughes has hauled in 28 receptions for 408 yards and three touchdowns, while the 6-3, 215-pound D&rsquo;Arcy, a senior wide receiver, has 10 catches for 64 yards and a touchdown. Both are also effective downfield blockers. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>George, a 6-foot-2, 210-pound sophomore backup QB, has chipped in with four tackles on special teams.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Two weeks ago, Hughes caught a 22-yard scoring pass on a fake field goal attempt as Wesleyan rallied from a 14-0 deficit to defeat Bowdoin.  &ldquo;Kevin is probably the smartest football player I&rsquo;ve coached in almost 30 years,&rdquo; said <strong>Mike Whalen</strong>, in his third season at  Wesleyan. &ldquo;His versatility has made him a special player and he has incredible hands. He&rsquo;s one of the top skill players in the NESCAC.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Shifting to D&rsquo;Arcy, he added, &ldquo;Dan came here as a quarterback, but we felt he could really be a factor at receiver. It&rsquo;s been a transition for him and he&rsquo;s improved every year.&rdquo; </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Whalen said he had an eye on Hughes when he was head coach at Williams. &ldquo;He has one more year of eligibility and if he comes back, no question he&rsquo;ll be a top receiver in this league.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Selected for the  Shriners&rsquo; Classic as a senior at Acton-Boxborough, Hughes scored two touchdowns in his first college varsity game against Bowdoin as a freshman. &ldquo;That gave me a lot of confidence going into last season,&rdquo; said the Boxborough resident, who has added 30 pounds since high school. &ldquo;But this year has been even more special. Our field was packed for homecoming against Amherst,&rdquo; with a crowd of more than 7,000 fans,  he said. &ldquo;I've never seen that many alumni at a home game.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Two of his  teammates at Acton-Boxborough now play for NESCAC opponents,  <strong>Ethan Dukes</strong>
    &nbsp;at Hamilton College and <strong>Pat Gilligan
    </strong>&nbsp;at Bates College.  </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;I had a chance to chat with Ethan at the postgame tailgate. He threw a touchdown pass to me in high school,&rdquo; Hughes said. &ldquo;I also saw Pat briefly and we had a chance to shake hands. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d all agree that we had great coaching in high school from <strong>Bill Maver
    </strong>&nbsp;and his staff who helped make it possible for us to get to the next level.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>D&rsquo;Arcy, who was succeeded as Concord-Carlisle&rsquo;s quarterback by George, was a two-time league all-star in high school and also earned a berth in the Shriners game. &ldquo;I hurt my shoulder in my last high school game,&rdquo; recalled D&rsquo;Arcy, who while at Concord-Carlisle would throw passes to <strong>Zach Driscoll</strong>,&nbsp;who is having a record-breaking senior season at NESCAC rival Middlebury.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been challenging to make the move&rsquo;&rsquo; to receiver, D&rsquo;Arcy said, &ldquo;especially after missing most of my sophomore year with a hamstring injury, so I take a lot of pride in what I&rsquo;ve been able to accomplish,  especially my blocking.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Zach  Driscoll &ldquo;is a good friend and we work out together in the offseason,&rsquo;&rsquo; D&rsquo;Arcy said. &ldquo;Peter George was two years behind me at Concord-Carlisle, and had stayed with me when he made his recruiting visit to Wesleyan.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Other Concord-Carlisle alums playing for NESCAC football teams are <strong>Ryan Ruiz
    </strong>&nbsp;(Colby) and <strong>Jibrail Coy
    </strong>&nbsp;(Bowdoin).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Whalen said George, who also plays varsity lacrosse for Wesleyan, is continuing to develop as a dropback quarterback and has been a productive special teams player,  and Curley has flourished since moving from the defensive line. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;Jim is our only senior on the offensive line and a leader who should get all-conference recognition,&rdquo; said Whalen, who added that Bartlett, a graduate of Xaverian Brothers High, is coming back from knee surgery and should compete for more playing time next season.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="">
    <p>George was a Dual County all-star in football and lacrosse; the 6-foot-3, 245-pound Curley, who is the PA announcer at Wesleyan&rsquo;s ice hockey games, was a two-time Independent School League all-star pick in football; and the 6-foot, 230-pound Bartlett was Xaverian&rsquo;s Unsung Hero and an All-Catholic Conference selection.

    <div><div><p>@Chelmsfordmom - your earlier comment: &quot;what Obama said was outright communism&quot; - yes, but that is the real Obama.  Go back and ask WRKO for the audio tapes of callers/listeners, from the 2007-2008'ish era...and the folks with Howie Carr, got it right.  Obama's grades may have been sealed, but his activities, *friends* etc., they got it right, they know Obama best.  Unfortunately for Obama, &quot;We The People&quot; and the Constitution, Bill of Rights, etc.-guide us as a nation.  Not him.  And your second comment: &quot;Paul Ryan is too far to the right, if he and Mitt gave in some on reproductive rights issues I think the outcome would have been different.&quot;.....well, that is why Romney/Ryan 2012 picked up so much momentum, Paul Ryan's thinking of being far to the right, actually does appeal to a lot of voters.  Hence Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney picked up those votes, and not the pro-Obama socialist vote; note: he's not your typical liberal left-leaning democrat, he is a socialist.  His talks, his books...his viewpoint.  Read further on his financial supporters background(s). </p>
    
    <p>The writer above who wrote about &quot;tax and spend liberal in the White House, can we get someone to look into using marijuana as a taxable, legal revenue stream? Two states have voted for all-out legalization for adults&quot;......that's an interesting point, strictly from a financial tax-raising standpoint.  </p>
    
    <p>And no, I do not use marijuana.  Never have.</p></div></div>

    </p><p>According to numbers on boston.com, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2fnews%2fspecial%2fpolitics%2f2012%2fgeneral%2fmass-ballot-questions-election-results-2012.html%23local\">85 percent of voters</a> approved the question, with 51 percent of the state reporting at 10:15 p.m.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The initiative requires automakers to make computer software codes for repairs more accessible to independent repair shops and car owners by 2015. But in July, state legislators devised a compromise that would give carmakers until 2018 to comply with the new law, according to a <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flive.boston.com%2fEvent%2fLive_blog_Election_day_2012%2f56081560\">Boston Globe report</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>By approving Question 1, voters trumped that compromise and enacted the \xE2\x80\x9CRight to Repair\xE2\x80\x9D act as written on the ballot.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CVoters sent a clear message to automakers\xE2\x80\x94it\xE2\x80\x99s my car, I paid for it, I\xE2\x80\x99ll get it fixed where I want, not where some big corporation tells me to,\xE2\x80\x9D said Art Kinsman of the Massachusetts Right to Repair Committee Tuesday night. \xE2\x80\x9CRight to Repair is about true ownership. When you buy a car from a manufacturer\xE2\x80\x99s dealer, you ought to have the information necessary to fix that vehicle. Technology should never leave the rights of car owner behind.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Question 2: Death with Dignity</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Widely referred to as a question to support assisted suicide, the \"Death with Dignity\" ballot initiative would allow doctors to prescribe medication that a patient could take to end their own lives.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>As of 11 p.m. Tuesday, the question is <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2fnews%2fspecial%2fpolitics%2f2012%2fgeneral%2fmass-ballot-questions-election-results-2012.html%23local\">too close to call</a>\xE2\x80\x9451 percent in favor, 49 percent against\xE2\x80\x94with 67 percent of the state reporting results.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The vote remained too close to call at 7:55 a.m. Wednesday, with 93 percent of the state reporting results\xE2\x80\x9451 percent against, 49 percent in favor. There is approximately a 38,000-vote differential.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>However, according to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww1.whdh.com%2fnews%2farticles%2fpolitics%2fmassachusetts%2f12008998795975%2fbackers-of-mass-doctor-assisted-suicide-concede%2f%23ixzz2BXg8SKAF\">WHDH 7News</a>, supporters of the \"Death with Dignity\" act conceded Wednesday morning.

    </p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Question 3: Medical Marijuana</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>You may be able to use marijuana legally, if your doctor determines that it will help with your medical condition.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Voters approved Question 3, which will allow doctors to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.sec.state.ma.us%2fele%2fele12%2fballot_questions_12%2fquest_3.htm\">prescribe marijuana</a> as part of a treatment, Tuesday.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    &#13;\n\
    </p><p>Massachusetts is the 18th state to legalize medical marijuana. <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2fmetrodesk%2f2012%2f11%2f06%2fmassachusetts-voters-approve-ballot-measure-legalize-medical-marijuana%2fEpDzgJGfBjnOAkoXpJwm1K%2fstory.html\">According to the Boston Globe,</a> under the new law, patients with HIV, multiple sclerosis, hepatitis C, or other conditions can obtain a card from the state allowing them to purchase the drug.</p>\n\

    </p><p>\"I don't expect much, if any accumulation in the Boston area, maybe a slushy coating around Rte. 128 on grassy surfaces as rain and snow battle it out for a few hours in the early evening,\" wrote Lambert on the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww1.whdh.com%2fweather%2fblog%2fpage%2f1%2f\">7 Weather Blog</a>. \"The snow will lose that battle to rain, although that process takes longer outside 495.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\

    					<div class="firstGraph">
    <p>By Craig Forde
    
    Globe Correspondent
    
    
    </p>
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>When Felix De Bona was called to the office of Somerville High School athletic director Nicole Viele on a Wednesday morning, a million thoughts raced through his head.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Two days earlier he had spent a few hours at the MIAA offices in Franklin, sitting in front of a three-person Eligibility Review Board, pleading his case for a waiver to play soccer in his senior year at Somerville.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Because of his background and age, the 19-year-old De Bona knew that it might be a tough sell, as did Viele and soccer coach George Scarpelli.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t really confident that they would approve him,&rdquo; said Scarpelli. &ldquo;But we were going to do everything in our power to try and get this kid that waiver.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>After De Bona entered Viele&rsquo;s office, shut the door, and sat down, he looked across the desk and heard her first word, &ldquo;Unfortunately .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;My heart was beating through my chest, I thought I was in trouble for something,&rdquo; said De Bona. 
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>However, Viele was being lighthearted about the situation that had taken nearly a month to be resolved, and she finished her sentence with, &ldquo;You got your waiver and you can play soccer.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>A rush of relief engulfed De Bona and that afternoon he pulled on his No. 9 Highlanders jersey for the first time, logging five minutes against Everett, where he had starred for two seasons.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Almost instantly, anonymous naysayers started hitting the Internet in attempts to dispel De Bona&rsquo;s eligibility. 
    
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>They questioned his age, stating that he is anywhere from 21 to 25, and they questioned his amateur status, stating that he was a professional soccer player in Spain prior to reaching Somerville.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>
    <span class="crosshead">Over and back</span>
    </p>
    </div>
    
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In pursuit of better employment opportunities, De Bona&rsquo;s parents uprooted their family from Felix&rsquo;s birthplace in Urussanga, Brazil, in 2001.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Their journey took them to Everett, and 8-year-old Felix found himself in a new country with no friends, unable to speak the language.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>He used soccer as his outlet, constantly honing his skills while getting accustomed to his new surroundings.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Soon enough he had built up friendships and a better understanding of the new culture around him.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>By the time  he reached Everett High School in 2008 he was a can&rsquo;t-miss striker, powering home 26 goals as a freshman and 20 more in his sophomore season.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Out of season, De Bona was good enough to play with the New England Revolution&rsquo;s Youth Academy, where he was paired with Leominster&rsquo;s Diego Fagundez on the Under-16 team in 2009-10. That season, the forwards netted 24 goals apiece, putting thoughts of a pro contract in their heads.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;We both just wanted to score the goals and help out the team,&rdquo; said Fagundez. &ldquo;He was that guy that would come up big on plays. He was a player that I could count on out there.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>When the Revolution awarded Fagundez their homegrown contract, De Bona decided to pursue his professional dreams overseas.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Contrary to Internet reports, he did not sign a contract to play for Malaga CF of Spain&rsquo;s famed La Liga.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Instead, De Bona caught on with the youth club team of Polideportivo Ejido, 
    in Spain&rsquo;s Second Division.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Just like with the Revolution, De Bona was part of an academy squad, playing against others in his age range but against stiffer competition than the academy teams in the United States. 
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;If I was ever a pro, I would still be one,&rdquo; said De Bona, who was never compensated to play. &ldquo;Why would I be here if I was a pro?&rdquo; </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>He played with Polideportivo for six months then returned to Brazil, where he completed his junior year of academics.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>He soon found himself playing pickup matches on the street because there was no local team. 
    Eventually De Bona made the difficult decision to return to Massachusetts on his own, moving in with a family friend in Somerville after he registered to complete his high school education there.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>He was ineligible to return to the Revolution&rsquo;s Youth Academy because of his age, and unable to afford the expenses that come with joining a local club team.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>His only chance for playing organized soccer fell at the doorstep of Somerville High School. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Scarpelli was all-too-familiar with De Bona. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>His Highlanders had been on the wrong end of many of De Bona&rsquo;s finishing strikes, but he was willing to help De Bona play out his high school eligibility.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Scarpelli had a team capable of making a run at a state championship before De Bona was around, but he saw a kid willing to do the right things.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="">
    <p>&ldquo;Gentlemen first, scholars second, athletes third,&rdquo; said senior captain Matheus Reis. &ldquo;That is Coach&rsquo;s motto for us. It&rsquo;s what we all live by and we are a closer family because of it. Felix is a great example of all of this.&rdquo;

                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; Two years ago, Republicans swept Democrats into a small minority in New Hampshire&rsquo;s state Senate and House. The results of Tuesday&rsquo;s election flipped that around.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>House Democratic Leader Terie Norelli said Wednesday preliminary counts show Democrats won 217 House seats and Republicans 177, with six races still to be decided. If Republicans were to win all six, Democrats will be in the majority again, she said. That would be at least a 115-seat gain for Democrats in the 400-member chamber.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Norelli, of Portsmouth, plans to run for House speaker and faces a challenge from Nashua Democrat David Campbell. Norelli served as speaker the four years Democrats controlled the House.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Campbell declined to comment on his strategy to win the House&rsquo;s top job, but Norelli said she&rsquo;s confident she has the votes to reclaim it. She said she has worked for eight months to recruit Democratic candidates and then help them with their campaigns.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I think I am well positioned to be the next speaker of the House,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The winner would succeed Mont Vernon Republican Bill O'Brien, who treated Democrats largely as irrelevant because of their small numbers. He also was a lightning rod for conservative issues ranging from repealing gay marriage to championing a law barring employers from negotiating labor contracts that require workers who don&rsquo;t want to join a union to pay a share of the union administrative costs, called an agency fee.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Norelli said she thinks voters did not like the acrimonious tone at the Statehouse under O'Brien.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;We need to do what everyone says we need to do and that is to focus on the economy and jobs,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>O'Brien congratulated Democrats on their victory and indicated he will not seek the job as minority leader. He said he will work with the new House Republican leader on delivering a low tax, job-friendly state that maximizes personal freedoms. O'Brien said he also planned to rebuild his law practice.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The secretary of state&rsquo;s office was working on a final breakdown of House seats.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Republicans retained control of the Senate, but lost six seats. Their margin is 13-11 instead of the 19-5 margin they enjoyed until a senator resigned last spring to run in a different district.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Senate President Peter Bragdon, R-Milford, said Wednesday he is seeking re-election to head the chamber and was the unanimous choice of his caucus.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Bragdon said he has worked with Norelli, Campbell and Democratic Gov.-elect Maggie Hassan, who was Senate majority leader until being swept out of office in 2010.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Any of the three, I have a relationship with,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Norelli also said if she&rsquo;s chosen speaker she would have no trouble working with Bragdon or Hassan.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I think Peter is a very reasonable person and I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have any problem working with him,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>House Republicans meet Nov. 15 to nominate a speaker, while the Democrats pick a candidate on Nov. 17. The Legislature is sworn in and organizes on Dec. 5. Unless a coalition is formed of Republican and Democratic members in each chamber, the majority party&rsquo;s nominee traditionally becomes House speaker and Senate president.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="">
    <p>Democrats won control of the House in 2006 and kept it until the 2010 election, ending a drought dating back to 1922 when the party had last enjoyed a majority in the chamber.<img alt="end of story marker" border="0" height="8" width="6" src="http://www.boston.com/r/SysConfig/WebPortal/Boston/Framework/images/site_graphics/dingbat_story_end_icon.gif" class="storyend"></p>

  title: Vine Brook Tavern Looks to Open Early Next Week

    <p><b><br></b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>If all went according to plan, Lexington\xE2\x80\x99s newest eatery would have enjoyed a soft open on Election Day, and then something with a little more fanfare early next week. But, as has been the case with so many things over the last few weeks in the northeast, Sandy had a say in the opening of <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fvinebrooktavern.com%2f\">Vine Brook Tavern</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Marcus Palmer, the restaurant\xE2\x80\x99s owner/operator, confirmed Tuesday that the opening was delayed until early next week, due to complications stemming from the superstorm that slammed the northeast last week. A <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fvinebrooktavern.com%2f\">countdown on the eatery\xE2\x80\x99s website</a> puts the opening at 5 p.m. next Tuesday, Nov. 13.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>When Vine Brook Tavern does open, patrons can expect a thoughtful menu, hospitable service and a welcoming environment fit for an evening out or larger family events, according to Palmer.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CWe expect people to do multiple courses here,\xE2\x80\x9D he said. \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s not going to be a turn-and-burn. For us, dining is leisurely.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A paint job has transformed the exterior of the building, formerly home to Vinny T\xE2\x80\x99s and, more recently, Buca di Beppo. While going from yellow to a colonial blue-grey has been dramatic, Palmer said the interior transformation has turned out even better than he imagined.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Reclaimed barn wood, reclaimed/custom light fixtures and custom furniture, plus a menu featuring elevated regional fare, will separate Vine Brook Tavern from its predecessors. Well, that and a name chef like Chris Frothingham, whose past gigs include stints with Palmer and celebrity chef Todd English.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s nice to work with someone I\xE2\x80\x99ve worked with before,\xE2\x80\x9D Palmer said of Frothingham, \xE2\x80\x9CAnd his strong suit is contemporary American.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>According to Palmer, the menu will be reflective of the eatery\xE2\x80\x99s name, and will feature regional fare with a twist. For instance, there might be meatloaf, but it\xE2\x80\x99ll be crusted with porcini mushrooms.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>If the cuisine is upscale, the pricepoint will be reasonable, Palmer said. Appetizers start in single digits and entrees in the $17 to $25 range, but with the occasional special skews toward the higher end.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>And, true to its name, the Vine Brook Tavern\xE2\x80\x99s concept extends to the drink menu. Palmer said there will be 24 quality beers and 24 quality wines available, along with some signature cocktails.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The restaurant will seat about 130, with private event availability for parties of anywhere from 14 to 40.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Expect dinner hours to be from 5 to 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday, with a bar menu available until 11 p.m. and the bar closing at midnight. On Sundays, dinner will be from 4 to 9 p.m., with the bar likely open until 11 p.m.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Vine Brook Tavern will also offer a Friday, Saturday and Sunday lunch and brunch, with those hours being from about 11:45 a.m. through 3 p.m. on those days.</p>\n\

    <p>AKRON, Ohio -- While the records for Akron (1-9, 0-6) and Massachusetts (0-9, 0-5) may make you cringe, the matchup at InfoCision Stadium could produce the most competitive contest in Mid-American Conference football this week. </p>
    <p>Both teams are desperate for that first conference victory. For UMass and coach Charley Molnar -- the former Mogadore resident and Kent State assistant coach -- this is the first of three games (Akron, Buffalo, Central Michigan) the Minutemen have a shot to win. </p>
    <p>UMass is in its first season at the Football Bowl Subdivision level, and earlier games against Connecticut, Indiana, Michigan and Vanderbilt -- not to mention a crossover game with the MAC's West Division powerhouse, Northern Illinois -- were all over the Minutemen's head. </p>
    <p>But in the MAC East, UMass has been competitive. It has lost to Ohio, 37-34; Miami, 27-16; and Bowling Green, 24-0. </p>
    <p>The rebuilding Zips have been just as competitive, losing to OU, 34-28; Miami, 56-49; and BG, 24-10. </p>
    <p>Akron coach Terry Bowden said senior quarterback Dalton Williams "played his best game of the season" last week in a 35-24 loss at Kent State. That bodes well for the Zips, as Williams, a transfer from Stephen F. Austin, leads the conference in passing. </p>
    <p>Williams has thrown for 3,003 yards and 24 touchdowns. No other MAC quarterback is within 500 yards of Williams' total or has more than 19 touchdowns. </p>
    <p>Considering UMass is coming off losses of 63-0 to Northern Illinois and 49-7 to Vanderbilt in its past two games, another big day from Williams could be the key to unlocking the Zips' first MAC victory. </p>
    
    			
    			
    		</div></div>
  summary: While neither team has a stellar record, the Minutemen and Zips could provide a compelling matchup on Saturday.

He was convicted of aggravated murder and attempted murder in the deaths of three men and wounding of a fourth.</p><p>The sentenci<span>ng was delayed from Monday amid talks on a deal for leniency in return for </span><span>Rafferty's</span><span> testimony against the alleged triggerman. </span><span>Rafferty</span><span> was looking to avoid a life sentence without hope of parole.</span></p><p><span>The jury rejected the defense claim that </span><span>Rafferty</span><span> feared for himself and his family if he didn't cooperate with his co-defendant, Richard Beasley of Akron.</span></p><p><span>The 53-year-old Beasley, described as the teen's spiritual mentor, has pleaded not guilty and faces a Jan. 7 trial.</span></p><p><span>Prosecutors  say the victims, all down in their luck and with few family ties that  might highlight their disappearance, were lured with phony offers of  farmhand jobs on Craigslist last year.</span></p><p><span>One man was killed near Akron and the others were shot at a southeast Ohio farm during bogus job interviews.</span></p><p><span>Prosecutors say robbery was the motive.</span></p><p><span>Rafferty</span><span>,  a high school student from Stow near Akron, was tried as an adult but  didn't face a possible death penalty because he is a juvenile.</span></p><p><span>Beasley, an ex-convict and self-styled street minister from Akron, could face the death penalty if convicted.</span></p><p><span>The surviving victim, 49-year-old Scott Davis of South Carolina, testified as the prosecution's star witness. He identified </span><span>Rafferty</span><span> as Beasley's accomplice and told the jury a harrowing story.</span></p><p><span>Davis,  who was looking to move close to his family in the Canton area, said he  was walking across what turned out to be a bogus job site when he heard  a gun cock and turned and found himself face to face with a handgun. He  said he pushed the weapon aside, was shot in the arm and fled through  the woods.</span></p><p><span>During </span><span>Rafferty's</span><span> trial,  defense attorney John Alexander painted Beasley as the mastermind and  said that the first killing came without warning for </span><span>Rafferty</span><span>.</span></p><p>The  three murdered men were Ralph Geiger, 56, of Akron; David Pauley, 51,  of Norfolk, Va.; and Timothy Kern, 47, of Massillon. Authorities say  they were targeted because they were older, single, out-of-work men with  backgrounds that made it unlikely their disappearances would be noticed  right away.</p></div></div>

  title: New McDonald's Proposal Tabled by Fairlawn Planning Commission

    </p><p><a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ffairlawn-bath.patch.com%2flistings%2fmcdonalds-1390\">McDonald's</a>\xC2\xA0representatives presented their plan for a 4,500-square foot restaurant to the commission and explained that drive-thru would account for 70 percent of the customer base.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Representative Gust Mecera promised non-invasive LED lighting, volume-controlled speakers and minimal trash on the property.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"The building has a contemporary look,\" Mecera said. \"It's a quality building that uses stone, metal and brick. We don't use any giant signs.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Getting in and out of the proposed McDonald's from West Market Street would be a right-in and right-out only. Customers could also enter and exit using Shiawasee.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>But those promises didn't satisfy the concerns of the standing-room only crowd. Fifteen residents, of the between 50 to 60 in the room, talked about traffic concerns, trash on the side streets, safety of area children and the people a McDonald's attracts.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"I chose to live on Abington Road because I thought it would be a nice place to raise children,\" said resident Stephani Itibrout. \"I'm concerned about the 20-plus children that I know of who ride bikes and walk in the area if 70 percent of the traffic is drive-thru.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>One resident questioned the restaurant's hours of operation, but none of the McDonald's representatives could answer.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Laurie Gamauf, who also lives on Abington Road, is concerned about the amount of traffic. She was also concerned about the effect a McDonald's would have on the area's property values.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"People use Abington Road is a cut-through as it is,\" Gamauf said. \"Turning left onto Shiawassee from Abington will be a nightmare. And God help you if you want to turn into Rockne's or the bank.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Abington Road resident Harry Tipping is also concerned with traffic congestion and asked that a traffic study be completed. He's also concerned about the effect a McDonald's will have on the other restaurants in the area.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"You've got <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ffairlawn-bath.patch.com%2flistings%2frocknes-10\">Rockne's</a> there, and <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ffairlawn-bath.patch.com%2flistings%2fivans-deli-and-catering\">Ivan's Deli</a>,\" Tipping said. \"You should review the economic impact that McDonald's will have on them and on our home values.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Several people said they were against putting more fast food in the area, and asked that a small coffee or donut shop be built instead.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The vacant land sits in Susan Sullivan's Ward 5 and she is opposed to the building as well.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"There are 21,000 cars that travel by that property on West Market each day,\" Sullivan said and pulled out a stack of police reports from the Montrose McDonald's. \"Problems exist and we don't need this. It's a vacant lot and we'll take care of it, but we can't just give this lot away and destroy a neighborhood in the process.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Mayor William Roth said he received concerns from residents about the land being contaminated because of the dry cleaner next door. However, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ffairlawn-bath.patch.com%2flistings%2fcavalier-cleaners-2\">Cavalier</a> doesn't do any dry cleaning on the property, so there are no chemicals in the soil.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"We've had Duncan Donuts and Waffle House look at this site before and walk away,\" Roth said. \"It's a difficult site. A traffic study would be very expensive.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>After hearing concerns and not having answers to several of the residents' questions, McDonald's representatives asked to table the proposal, meaning it won't be voted on until December, if McDonald's comes back with changes and answers by then.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The crowd was not happy with the decision and demanded a vote, but the commission decided to table.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>McDonald's has asked for several variances on the property, including setback and acreage, and those will go before the Board of Zoning and Appeals at 6:30 p.m. Nov. 15 in council chambers.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The next Planning Commission meeting is at 5:30 p.m. on Dec. 13.</p>\n\

    <p>Shortly before nightfall, about 100 people huddled together in the middle of <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpatch.com%2fL-qQ1h\">Ross Park</a>. </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CDo you need a tissue? I have tissues,\xE2\x80\x9D offered one girl.</p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99m going to cry again,\xE2\x80\x9D said another.</p><p>The somber crowd cried, embraced and waited as they held onto mostly black and yellow balloons. </p><p>A woman with a shaky voice announced they would let Alex Harr go when they let go of their balloons. </p><p>Then they counted to 25, said \xE2\x80\x9CWe love you Alex,\xE2\x80\x9D and the balloons rose into the sky.</p><p>Loved  ones, friends and classmates again embraced one another as they  remembered 14-year-old Harr, who died Monday. </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CHe was a very popular kid, a local leader, the kid you went to to score touchdown,\xE2\x80\x9D said Scott Raver, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpatch.com%2fL-kH90\">Roberts Middle School</a> football coach. \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s a horrible shock to our community, especially the day after the season ended.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Summit County Medical Examiner has yet to determine the cause of death.\xC2\xA0</p><p>Teammate and friend Damien Fleming said in the four or five years he knew Harr, he can\xE2\x80\x99t say he ever had a bad time together.</p><p>\xE2\x80\x9C(It was) always  fun to play football with him because he always had the greatest yell  and made everyone smile and laugh,\xE2\x80\x9D Fleming said. \xE2\x80\x9C(He) made it fun to  come to football and work for two-and-a-half hours.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>Harr  played baseball, basketball and wrestled. Friends said Harr\xE2\x80\x99s football jersey number, 25, will be retired.</p><p>Off  the field, friends remembered Harr as always laughing, smiling,  cracking jokes \xE2\x80\x94 not the serious type. He put others before himself, was  a talented artist and, Fleming added, Harr had a thing for the ladies.</p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CAlex  was a very loyal friend,\xE2\x80\x9D Kaley Capron, 13, said. \xE2\x80\x9CYou could feel  comfortable telling him anything. He had the best advice. He always had  the best attitude.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>That attitude has been a comfort the past few days.</p><p>\xE2\x80\x9COne  of the two things I remembered was we were sitting in his backyard,\xE2\x80\x9D  said friend and former teammate Tony Battalio, 14. \xE2\x80\x9CWe were messing  around and we had his basketball hoop by his trampoline and he decides  to jump off the roof (and) shoot it. He lands and just snaps (the trampoline) in half.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>\xE2\x80\x9COr  being at Caleb\xE2\x80\x99s and me and him were playing catch with a football,\"\xC2\xA0 Fleming chimed in. \"He didn\xE2\x80\x99t have the greatest arm and he tossed it in the street and a car  ran over it.\xE2\x80\x9D </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CIt blew it up, and we ran\xE2\x80\x9D Capron said, laughing.</p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CWe all ran and screamed like little girls,\xE2\x80\x9D Fleming added.</p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CI remember that,\xE2\x80\x9D Capron said. \xE2\x80\x9CThat was great.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>As Fleming, Capron and Battalio reminisced, some left while others gathered round to talk about Harr.</p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CAlex  was a good man,\xE2\x80\x9D said cousin Jacob Harr, 15. \xE2\x80\x9CI love him so very much.  It\xE2\x80\x99s really sad that this has happened, but we\xE2\x80\x99ve got to think of the  best \xE2\x80\x94 all of the great times he had with a lot of people. All the  smiles that he put on people\xE2\x80\x99s faces.\xE2\x80\x9D </p><p>Jacob  said Harr always played with his younger sister, Rylee Eberhart,  and wrestled with Zoey, his German Shepard. Harr\xE2\x80\x99s mom, sisters Holly,  18, and Rylee, 7, were at the balloon release but left soon after. </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CWe\xE2\x80\x99ve just got to stay strong and support his mom,\xE2\x80\x9D Jacob said.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Following the announcement of Harr's death, the school has made counselors available, several friends said.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A commemorative <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.facebook.com%2fAlexJeffreyHarr%3ffref%3dts\">Facebook page</a> was created for Harr and amassed more than 700 likes by Wednesday night.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Calling hours will be from 6 to 8 p.m. Friday at  <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.silva-hostetler.com%2fonline-memorials%2fAlex-Harr\">Silva-Hostetler Funeral Home</a> in Barberton.

This Kent State team is very good, and I thought emotion would carry Akron only so far &mdash; and that &ldquo;far&rdquo; to me seemed like somewhere in the third quarter before the Flashes flexed their muscles and won going away. It&rsquo;s a credit to Bowden and his undermanned Zips to push a superior KSU team to the limit like they did.</span></p> <p><span>It&rsquo;s also a credit to coach Darrell Hazell and his Flashes to fend off such a focused, determined opponent who turned Saturday&rsquo;s game into a dogfight from start to finish. It shows this KSU team is capable of winning in almost any manner necessary.</span></p> <p><span>Saturday&rsquo;s game should serve Kent State very well entering the season&rsquo;s home stretch &mdash; and Akron going forward next season.</span></p> <p>&bull;&bull;&bull;</p> <p><span>The University of Akron&rsquo;s athletic slogan is: &ldquo;Fear the Roo.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><span>My slogan following a UA loss to Kent State is: &ldquo;Fear the Kazoo.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><span>Despite my best efforts, my KSU-graduate aunt managed to slip through my technological defenses a mere seconds following Kent State&rsquo;s win over Akron on Saturday and treat me to a heartfelt playing of &ldquo;Fight On For KSU&rdquo; on the kazoo &mdash; over my speakerphone, no less.</span></p> <p><span>Once again, she outsmarted me in our decades-long game of Spy vs. Spy.</span></p> <p><span>For the record, she was an Honors student during her school days. Me, not so much.</span></p> <p>&bull;&bull;&bull;</p> <p><span>If you&rsquo;re looking for something to do Friday night, you could do a lot worse than making a trip to Hudson High School and watching the state-playoff football game between Kent Roosevelt and Aurora.</span></p> <p><span>Several future Division I collegiate players will be on the field that night, coached by two of the best coaches in the state of Ohio, Roosevelt&rsquo;s John Nemec and Aurora&rsquo;s Bob Mihalik.</span></p> <p><span>It should be an entertaining, hard-hitting game featuring superior athletes on both sides, played in the Explorers&rsquo; beautiful 6,000-seat football facility &mdash; a classic Friday Night Lights type of evening.</span></p> <p>&bull;&bull;&bull;</p> <p><span>Pat Shurmur certainly isn&rsquo;t making a very strong case to be retained as the Browns&rsquo; head coach following this season, and the 25-15 loss to Baltimore on Sunday was the latest example.</span></p> <p><span>Head-scratching play-calling, bone-headed clock management and an overall lack of direction led to defeat in yet another game the Browns could have won &mdash; and it&rsquo;s a sure bet that none of this has gone unnoticed by new owner Jimmy Haslam III, who isn&rsquo;t getting much return on the billion dollars he shelled out to buy the franchise.</span></p> <p><span>At this point, it would be a shock if Shurmur makes it through the season if this type of incompetence continues much longer.</span></p> <p><span>&bull;&bull;&bull;</span></p> <p> <p><span><strong>Phone: </strong>330-541-9446</span></p></p></div>"

    When <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fNathaniel%2520Folsom">Nathaniel Folsom</a>, newly appointed general of the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fNew%2520Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> troops, arrived at the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fsiege%2520of%2520Boston">siege of Boston</a> in late June 1775, he found this chain of command:<br>

    Those others included <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fWilliam%2520Heath">William Heath</a>, <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fJoseph_Frye">Joseph Frye</a>, and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.geni.com%2fpeople%2fBrig-Gen-John-Whitcomb%2f6000000008174405808">John Whitcomb</a> of Massachusetts; <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.connecticutsar.org%2fpatriots%2fspencer.htm">Joseph Spencer</a> and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fIsrael%2520Putnam">Israel Putnam</a> of <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fConnecticut">Connecticut</a>; and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fNathanael%2520Greene">Nathanael Greene</a> of <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fRhode%2520Island">Rhode Island</a>, as well as Folsom himself. </p><p>I wrote about Folsom&#8217;s difficulty asserting his authority over Col. <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fJohn%2520Stark">John Stark</a> <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2f2011%2f06%2fgeneral-folsom-and-colonel-stark.html">back here</a>. One week after the New Hampshire officers had worked out their differences, Gen. <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fGeorge%2520Washington">George Washington</a> arrived in <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fCambridge">Cambridge</a> and upset the whole arrangement. </p><p>There doesn&#8217;t seem to have been any resistance to the Virginian becoming the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fContinental%2520Congress">Continental Congress</a>&#8217;s new commander-in-chief. Rather, he also brought along the Congress&#8217;s commissions for subordinate generals, and they didn&#8217;t match the situation on the ground. Ward had already written to <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fJohn%2520Hancock">John Hancock</a> that the new appointments might &#8220;create Uneasiness among us; which we ought, at this critical Time, to be extremely careful to avoid.&#8221; </p><p>The Congress has decided to rank the generals under Washington this way:<br>
    <ul>
    
    <li>as brigadier generals, <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fSeth_Pomeroy">Seth Pomeroy</a> of Massachusetts, <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fRichard%2520Montgomery">Richard Montgomery</a> of New York, <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fweb.cortland.edu%2fwoosterk%2fGen_David02.html">David Wooster</a> of Connecticut, Heath, Spencer, Thomas, <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fJohn%2520Sullivan">John Sullivan</a> of New Hampshire, Greene, and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fHoratio%2520Gates">Horatio Gates</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    Schuyler, Montgomery, and Wooster were assigned to the defense of northern New York/invasion of southern <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fCanada">Canada</a>.</p><p>The New England delegates in the Congress had tried to replicate the seniority of their colonies&#8217; militia officers, and were also swayed by reports of the Battle of <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fLexington">Lexington</a> and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fConcord">Concord</a> (which Heath had participated in) and the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2f2010%2f08%2fwhat-should-we-call-fighting-in-late.html">skirmish over Noddle&#8217;s Island</a> (which Putnam had led). The Congress therefore elevated Putnam over Spencer even though Connecticut had ranked Putnam third among its generals. The Congress also made Heath outrank Thomas even though Heath was taking orders from Thomas. </p><p>In addition, the Congress <i>hadn&#8217;t</i> learned several things. Pomeroy had never accepted his general&#8217;s rank in the Massachusetts army (though he had fought in the Battle of <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fBunker%2520Hill">Bunker Hill</a>). Frye, Whitcomb, and Folsom were all exercising commands in the army outside Boston. And on 23 June the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fMassachusetts%2520Provincial%2520Congress">Massachusetts Provincial Congress</a> had voted to make Col. <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fRichard%2520Gridley">Richard Gridley</a> of the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fartillery">artillery</a> regiment into another major general. </p><p>By the time Washington realized what a mess this was, he had already given Putnam his commission as Continental major general and couldn&#8217;t take it back. On 10 July he wrote to Philadelphia: <br>
    <blockquote>
    The great Dissatisfaction expressed on this Subject &amp; the apparent Danger of throwing the whole Army into the utmost Disorder, together with the strong Representations made by the Provincial Congress, have induced me to retain the Commissions in my Hands untill the pleasure of the Congress should be farther known&#8230; </blockquote>
    In fact, on 5 July, only three days after the new commander reached Cambridge, Spencer had convinced a large number of Connecticut officers to sign a letter to their legislature protesting the Congress&#8217;s decision and then set off for Hartford to deliver it himself. Or, as Washington wrote, &#8220;General Spencer was so much disgusted at the Preference given to General Puttnam, that he left the Army without visiting me, or making known his Intentions in any Respect.&#8221;</p><p>And Gen. Thomas was talking about leaving, too. </p><p>TOMORROW: Gen. Washington handles his first managerial crisis.</p>

    <p>Aldermen in Somerville spoke in support of a proposal to apply the city's ethics standards to nonprofits Thursday, but no action will be taken until it is reviewed by a subcommittee.</p>
    
    <p>An audit of the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.caasomerville.org%2f">Community Action Agency of Somerville </a>conducted in June found that its executive director, Kimberley Smith-Cofield, made over 100 personal purchases with an agency credit card. <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fbostonglobe.com%2fmetro%2f2012%2f11%2f05%2fsomerville-community-action-chief-smith-cofield-used-agency-credit-card-for-personal-expenses%2feKR5yhJSN0Q836z8tyJsBI%2fstory.html">The details of the audit were revealed in a Globe report this week</a>.</p>
    
    <p>During their meeting Thursday night at City Hall, Aldermen said they wanted to amend the municipal ethics standards to extend it to nonprofits awarded money by the city, but a proposal to do so had to be reviewed by the Legislative Matters Committee first.</p>
    
    <p>"This has been in front of this committee for a number of months and certainly considering some of the things that have happened lately, this must be pushed through," Alderman Sean O'Donovan said Thursday.</p>
    
    <p>The city's ethics standard requires elected officials to file financial interests statements with the city. The aldermen unanimously approved a motion to finalize the amendment "as soon as possible." They also approved a request to ask City Solicitor Frank Wright what power they have to force transparency in city nonprofits.</p>
    
    <p>Alderman Bob Trane, who submitted the initial proposed amendment with Mayor Joseph Curtatone as a sponsor, said the city needed more oversight of nonprofits awarded grants.</p>
    
    <p>"We don't want to see people running around with a credit card like they have carte-blanche on the citizens' dime," Trane said.</p>
    
    <p>The Legislative Matters Committee, chaired by Alderman Rebekah Gewirtz, is expected to meet next Tuesday, Nov. 13.</p></div>

    <p>The Somerville Board of Aldermen Thursday approved a $20,000 pay raise for the position of mayor.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The raise brings the mayor's salary from $125,000 to $145,000 a year.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    &#13;\n\
    </p><p>The raise came after a September study, commissioned by the city and conducted by the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.umb.edu%2fcpm%2f\">Collins Center for Public Management</a>\xC2\xA0at UMass Boston, recommended it.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The study compared municipal chief executive salaries among other cities in the Boston area. The mayor of Boston, for instance, makes $175,000 a year, according to the study. The town manager of Arlington makes $159,000 a year, and the town administrator of Brookline makes $164,612 a year. Medford's mayor makes $124,705, Malden's makes $105,900 and Newton's makes $125,000. The city manager of Cambridge makes a whopping $327,091, the study says.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Meanwhile, the aldermen did not approve a raise for themselves. Based on proceedings from Thursday's meeting, it appears many aldermen did not think it would be appropriate to give themselves a raise until the city reaches a contract resolution with the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fsmea.us%2f\">Somerville Municipal Employees Association</a>, which hasn't had a new contract since 2006.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A raise for the position of alderman would have bumped the salary from $24,999 to $25,750 a year.</p>\n\

    </p><p>Some aldermen wanted to make sure that accepting the grant didn't mean the relationship would go any further.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"I never want to say no to a grant or a gift, and I'm prepared to support this,\" said Ward 6 Alderman Rebekah Gewirtz, \"however, I feel we should make a statement there would be no reciprocation here. It is a big sum of money. Wal-Mart has tried to come to Somerville in the past.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"The issue of Wal-Mart coming is one that concerns me greatly and one that concerns members of the community,\" she said.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    &#13;\n\
    </p><p>Alderman At-Large William White wanted to assure people there were no strings attached to accepting Wal-Mart's grant. \"It does not indicate in any way, shape or form that any gift that goes into the city treasury, that goes to a worthwhile cause, is designed to any way grease the skids or result in any type of reward or favorable action.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Ward 4 Alderman Tony LaFuente said, \"I'm not a big fan of Wal-Mart \xE2\x80\xA6 I'm glad they're not in Somerville, and I hope they never come to Somerville, but I'll certainly, gladly take their money.\"</p>\n\

  title: Local Printer Visits Argenziano School to Teach the Fine Art of Letterpress, Donates Time, Materials
  community_id: "38"

  content: "<div><div><p>A group of sixth and seventh graders from the Argenziano  School in Somerville experienced a totally different kind of texting Nov. 1 and 2, when printer and designer Eli Epstein of Union Press took his showcard letterpress to art class with teacher Diana Taremi.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The youngsters all took a turn using the portable press to print a poster; each class choosing a different color for their image.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s communication deconstructed into its component parts, its letters,\xE2\x80\x9D said Taremi, admiring Epstein\xE2\x80\x99s choice of creating an alphabet poster. The poster, printed in different color by each of the four classes, contrasted with students\xE2\x80\x99 understanding of text. For them, text is an electronically transmitted message, this text, each wood-block letter carved in a different shape or font, was something they could actually hold.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CAre you pressing letters into paper?\xE2\x80\x9D Jackie Eloi, 7B, said when Epstein asked what the students thought letterpress printing is.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CYes, pressing letters into paper and leaving a mark,\xE2\x80\x9D Epstein said He explained that wood-block printing is one of the oldest printing methods dating back to the middle ages when whole pages of letters were carved from wooden blocks.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Printing was revolutionized when Johannes Gutenberg developed moveable type which could be used repeatedly to print the same page many times and then rearranged to print different pages. Still a painstaking process, it was quicker than hand copying text.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CHow long does it take to make a print?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Savanna Collins, 7B.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CThe more colors we use, the longer it takes,\xE2\x80\x9D Epstein said. \xE2\x80\x9CWe cut images by hand, set type by hand, feed the paper by hand, one sheet at a time, one color at a time. It\xE2\x80\x99s a long process.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>As Epstein talked about the history of printing, he mixed his inks, using a palate knife and a glass sheet to stretch the rubber-based color. He took turns inking the raised letters with his friend and assistant Lindsey Richard, of Somerville, who came along to lend a hand. They had placed the type in the press bed before arriving to allow each student to come and press a poster.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s a tactile experience,\xE2\x80\x9D Epstein said of letterpress printing. \xE2\x80\x9CI feel so great at the end of the day when I wash my hands knowing they are dirty because I used them to make something. I want to give the kids a taste that this is something they can do; get paid to make art.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Some students nonchalantly pulled the heavy roller across the paper that was stretched over the inked surface with one hand; others used both to pull the roller. The smiles were universal when they peeled the paper from the press and saw the alphabet in red, blue, green or purple.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CCool,\xE2\x80\x9D said Saja El-Saudi of her print, in a virant green mixed on-the-spot in the classroom by Epstein.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A group of sixth grade boys pulled their stools close to the printing press and watched avidly as their classmates pulled their prints; these inked in dark purple. They examined the posters, commenting on the intensity of the color, different for each poster, and pointed out the areas where the ink was sparse.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CEach piece of type is different, some of the older ones have worn edges, the less-used letters can have sharper edges,\xE2\x80\x9D Epstein said, explaining the discrepancies. Much of his wood type is between 50 and 100 years old. When letterpress was a common form of printing, the wood type was traced and carved from blocks by machines operated by skilled craftspeople.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Epstein hand carves images from linoleum blocks when he creates posters, cards, CD cases, wedding invitations for clients; the Union Square Farmers\xE2\x80\x99 Market, local musicians, the Somerville Arts Council.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>While still a graphic design student at Northeastern  University, Epstein, now 26, found designing on computers unfulfilling and searched for a different creative outlet. He spent three months as an intern in the Tennessee firm Hatch Show Prints, one of the country\xE2\x80\x99s oldest letterpress shops. On his return and while still an undergraduate, he took a continuing education course on letterpress at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>It was through his professor, Keith Cross, that he found what is now Union Press.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CI had been hired to organize and resurrect a collection of letterpress printing equipment once owned by a 'union' print shop called the City Press\xE2\x80\x9D Cross said of the beginnings of the press. Once he had finished the work, he was encouraged to run the shop as a regular printing business. He established Milk Row Press which included a Vadercook SP15 and a Chandler and Price platen press, and an extensive collection of both wood and metal type.</p><p>Cross, now a Worcester resident, left Somerville in 2002 and the equipment lay dormant for years. When Cross met Eli, he recognized that his student was serious about letterpress. Subsequently, Epstein stepped into the void and now operates the equipment as Union Press, located at 440 Somerville Ave., next to the Milk Row Cemetery (the origin of the original press name).</p><p>\xC2\xA0\xE2\x80\x9CEli utilizes an enviable collection of wood type and creates beautiful work\xE2\x80\x9D Cross said, admitting he missed the days he worked in that space.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Epstein has just expanded the shop into a larger space in the same building where he hopes to hold workshops and open his space to the public.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CI get so excited about what I do; I don\xE2\x80\x99t think letterpress should be limited access; I would like to be able to let people get their hands dirty with it,\xE2\x80\x9D Epstein said. \xE2\x80\x9CI like to know that when a letterpress print is touched, you can appreciate that someone made it with their hands.\xE2\x80\x9D\xC2\xA0 And added, laughing: \xE2\x80\x9CI let people put their fingerprints all over my stuff.\xE2\x80\x9D</p></div></div>"

                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) &mdash; European Central Bank President Mario Draghi has warned that the economy of the 17 countries that use the euro remains weak and will struggle to grow even with &lsquo;&lsquo;visibly improved&rsquo;&rsquo; confidence among the currency union&rsquo;s financial markets.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>After the ECB&rsquo;s governing council left its key interest rate unchanged at the record low of 0.75 percent, Draghi insisted the bank has done its part to haul the eurozone out of its financial crisis. Markets have rallied since the ECB offered in September to buy the bonds of countries such as Spain and Italy, which are struggling with borrowing costs on their debt.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Draghi said it was up to governments to improve investor confidence in the currency bloc by fixing their shaky public finances and cutting the bureaucracy and regulations that block stronger growth.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Economic activity in the euro area is expected to remain weak, although it continues to be supported by our monetary policy stance and financial market confidence has visibly improved on the back of our decisions,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said at a news conference in Frankfurt.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The slack economy poses a serious risk for the eurozone because only a broad rebound will help shrink the levels of government debt that have already pushed Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Cyprus into asking for bailouts. Government debt across the eurozone now averages 90 percent of annual economic output &mdash; well above the 60 percent limit under the region&rsquo;s fiscal rules.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Draghi said current evidence &lsquo;&lsquo;does not signal improvements toward the end of the year&rsquo;&rsquo; and that growth was suffering from &lsquo;&lsquo;heightened risk aversion,&rsquo;&rsquo; as consumers and companies seek to cut their debt and improve their finances.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>As part of its efforts to calm the financial crisis, the ECB in September said it was willing to buy bonds issued by heavily indebted countries with the aim of lowering their borrowing costs as long as they are willing to ask for the help and take steps to cut their deficits. Since then, stocks have risen and borrowing costs fallen &mdash; without the ECB spending a cent to intervene. The proposal alone appears to have helped instill greater confidence in the countries&rsquo; ability to pay down their debts.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>On Thursday, the interest rate for Spain&rsquo;s benchmark 10-year bond on the secondary market &mdash; an indicator of investor wariness of a country&rsquo;s economy &mdash; was at 5.8 percent, up marginally on recent days but still way down from the unsustainable highs of 7 percent it reached in July. Meanwhile the Stoxx 50 index of leading European shares was up 148 points to 2,527.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>While markets are feeling better, the outlook for the wider economy remains glum.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Budget cuts and tax increases imposed as part of austerity programs are weighing heavily on economies. The region&rsquo;s gross domestic product shrank 0.3 percent in the second quarter. The European Union&rsquo;s executive commission predicts it will shrink 0.4 percent this year, and, perhaps more alarmingly, grow only 0.1 percent all of next year. Unemployment is at 11.6 percent, highest the euro was introduced in 1999.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Five eurozone countries are in recession &mdash; Italy, Spain Portugal, Greece and Cyprus.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In theory, a cut to interest rates would stimulate the economy by making it easier for consumers and businesses to borrow, spend and invest. Yet low ECB rates and cheap ECB credit to banks are not getting through to the wider economy in the form of more loans. That&rsquo;s often because businesses see no reason to borrow and expand production in a slack economy.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Draghi indicated the bond purchase plan, by lowering borrowing rates in troubled countries and easing markets, was actually doing what an interest rate cut would normally do, calling it &lsquo;&lsquo;equivalent to a further expansion of monetary policy.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Analyst Christian Schulz said that the bond-purchase program &lsquo;&lsquo;has a stronger easing effect than any rate cut&rsquo;&rsquo; and that Draghi&rsquo;s insistence that the ECB is ready to use the program outweighs anything else the bank could do right now.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="">
    <p>The ECB has argued that it&rsquo;s up to countries to push ahead with so-called structural reforms &mdash; ones that make their economy more productive in the long term. Those typically include breaking down job protections for established workers so that companies can hire and fire more easily, and be more willing to higher younger workers. Spain and Greece have jobless rates of 54.2 percent and 55.6 percent respectively for people under 25.<img alt="end of story marker" border="0" height="8" width="6" src="http://www.boston.com/r/SysConfig/WebPortal/Boston/Framework/images/site_graphics/dingbat_story_end_icon.gif" class="storyend"></p>

  content: "<div><div>\n\
    <p><em>Update, 11:15 a.m., Nov. 8:</em> Pinkberry will not be coming to Davis Square, at least not in the near future.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>According to planning staff with the Zoning Board of Appeals, Pinkberry withdrew its application at the Board's meeting Wednesday night. It seems the Board was not inclined to grant permission to the frozen yogurt giant, so Pinkberry withdrew its application before it was officially denied.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><em>Original story:</em></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In the past three months, Davis Square has sprouted two new frozen yogurt establishments, and it looks like a third\xE2\x80\x94<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.pinkberry.com%2f\">Pinkberry</a>\xE2\x80\x94is on the way. All three yogurt places would be within about 320 feet of each other.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>First came <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fsomerville.patch.com%2farticles%2fquick-look-iyo-cafe-in-davis-square\">iYo Cafe</a>, a self-serve frozen yogurt parlor and coffee shop that opened at the beginning of August at 234 Elm St.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Then, in October, came another self-serve yogurt place, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fsomerville.patch.com%2farticles%2fnational-frozen-yogurt-chain-orange-leaf-coming-to-davis-square\">Orange Leaf Frozen Yogurt</a>, which is having a grand opening event on Nov. 10, at 260 Elm St. (Or is it 258 Elm St.? Or 256 Elm St.? More on that later.)</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Now Pinkberry, a global chain with more than 170 stores around the world, according to its website, is possibly moving into 263 Elm St., the storefront formerly occupied by <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fsomerville.patch.com%2flistings%2fmassachusetts-insurance-agency\">Massachusetts Insurance Agency</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.somervillema.gov%2fsites%2fdefault%2ffiles%2fagendas%2fZBA%252011-7-12.pdf\">Somerville Zoning Board of Appeals was scheduled to have a hearing</a> about Pinkberry, which was seeking special permits from the Board, on Nov. 7. (Somerville Patch did not know the results of that hearing as of this posting, but ZBA staff was recommending approval.)</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>And don't forget that <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fsomerville.patch.com%2flistings%2fjp-licks-at-davis-square\">J.P. Licks</a>, an ice cream parlor, is about 420 feet away from this yogurt nucleus.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Already, the sudden influx of frozen yogurt seems to have caused some tension in the square.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    &#13;\n\
    </p><p>At a ZBA hearing on Sept. 5, which Somerville Patch attended, iYo's owner explained why he appealed that decision: It didn't have to do with the competition, which he said he welcomed, but rather the city shouldn't issue permits to businesses with incorrect and inconsistent address.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Eventually, Orange Leaf had to file a second application with the correct address, which is, apparently, \"<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.somervillema.gov%2fsites%2fdefault%2ffiles%2fdocuments%2fElmSt256.pdf\">256 Elm Street a/k/a 260 Elm Street, #103.</a>\" Refiling the application delayed Orange Leaf's opening by over a month.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Now, Pinkberry's possible entry into Davis Square is causing some neighborhood complaints.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A post on <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fdavis-square.livejournal.com%2f3046429.html\">Davis Square LiveJournal</a> called on people to attend the Nov. 7 ZBA hearing to speak against Pinkberry. Among other things, the post says, \xC2\xA0\"There is no 'need' for such a facility in the square with (3) shops (JP Licks, Orange Leaf, iYO cafe) with the same use all located within two blocks from each other\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The writer asked people to sign an <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.change.org%2fpetitions%2fsomerville-ma-zoning-board-of-appeals-deny-the-special-permit-application-for-pinkberry-in-davis-square\">online petition</a> opposing Pinkberry in Davis Square. As of Wednesday afternoon it had 19 supporters.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>What do you think? Has frozen yogurt gotten out of hand in Davis Square, or is there room for everyone? Where will you get your yogurt in Davis Square?</strong></p>\n\

    <p>There's no reason for Somerville residents to leave town when they want eat out. But sometimes they do.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Here's some recent restaurant news from nearby non-Boston communities.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>ARLINGTON</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwingsover.com%2f\">Wings Over</a>, the franchise known for its airplane-inspired orders, such as the B-17 Bomber (60 wings), could be coming to East Arlington.\xC2\xA0Robert Savin, who already owns a handful of Wings Over franchises,\xC2\xA0is looking to open \xE2\x80\x9CWings Over Arlington\xE2\x80\x9D at what is now The Wing Place and what was WhattaWing! not too long ago. The requested location is at 218 Massachusetts Ave., just a few doors down from the\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2farlington.patch.com%2flistings%2fcapitol-theatre\">Capitol Theatre</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>MEDFORD</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>More restaurants are now eligible for liquor licenses in Medford, but a new ordinance hasn't caused of flood of applications.\xC2\xA0The ordinance change, approved by Gov. Deval Patrick last month, reduces the required number of seats at a restaurant seeking a full liquor license from 99 to 50.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>WAKEFIELD</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The restaurant, located at 33 Tuttle Street (near the train station) will feature stations for patrons to try a wide variety of dishes, from clam chowder and lobster sliders to rack of lamb, roasted tenderloin and, oysters on the half shell, and the Laurie\xE2\x80\x99s 9:09 Crabcake, among other dishes, all of which can be sampled for $24.99. The restaurant will serve its regular menu Tuesday through Saturday from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. and Sundays from noon until midnight.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>READING</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A company that started as a maker of gourmet pizza pies with flavored pizza dough is considering opening a restaurant on Haven Street, its first in the Commonwealth.\xC2\xA0Portland Pie Co., which opened in Portland, Maine, in 1997, has expanded its menu with appetizers, salads and sandwiches and full liquor service in five locations, according to its website: in Maine, in Portland, Scarborough and Westbrook and in New Hampshire, in Manchester and Nashua.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>WOBURN</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The City Council opened three public hearings regarding North Woburn projects, but all will need more discussion.In August, some North Woburn residents were upset to learn that a\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwoburn.patch.com%2farticles%2fn-woburn-rumor-is-real-cvs-petitions-city\">a CVS could be built on the current site of Mr. Charlie's ice cream shop</a>, while that eatery would move across the street into the\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwoburn.patch.com%2farticles%2fis-mr-charlie-s-moving\">the old Dunkin' Donuts spot in the shopping plaza.</a></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>NORTH READING</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Freeda's Pizza and Calzones, coming this November to the North Beverly Plaza, isn't your typical mom and pop pizza shop.\xC2\xA0Sure, the Guevara family has been operating\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.facebook.com%2fpages%2fMarios-01864%2f366197960119899\">Mario's Pizza in North Reading</a>\xC2\xA0for 30 years. And, yes, mom and pop, in this case, Alfina and Romeo, are the president and vice president of the company.\xC2\xA0But operations director Al Guevara says Freeda's, named after his mother, Alfina, whose nickname was Freeda when she grew up in Sicily, isn't the average.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Owners of Joe Fish in North Andover Jim Demetri and Jim Dietz went before the selectmen Monday night to have their liquor license approved for the new Joe Fish restaurant that will be located\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpatch.com%2fA-xxv3\">in the old Piccadilly Pub space</a>. The liquor license was approved unanimously.\xC2\xA0Both\xC2\xA0Demetri and\xC2\xA0Dietz co-own Joe Fish and the Loft in North Andover and plan to open another Joe Fish on Main Street in North Reading. The restaurant will have 150 seats and 20 bar seats, according to Demetri.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>WILMINGTON</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Having seen countless episodes, Paul Malvone has always been a fan of\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwilmington.patch.com%2farticles%2flocal-chefs-to-be-featured-on-diners-drive-ins-and-dives\">Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives</a>\xC2\xA0on the Food Network. It\xE2\x80\x99s safe to say, however, that Monday, Oct. 8 will always remain his favorite episode.\xC2\xA0Malvone and\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fbostonburgerco.com%2f\">Boston Burger Company</a>, his popular Somerville restaurant, were the focus of the opening segment on the newest edition of the popular show hosted by celebrity chef Guy Fieri.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>BURLINGTON</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Red Mango , the Number-1\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.zagat.com%2fbuzz%2fbest-frozen-yogurt-and-smoothies\">Zagat rated</a>\xC2\xA0frozen yogurt and smoothie chain in America, is expanding throughout Massachusetts. Joining more than 200 Red Mango stores across North America, Red Mango has awarded a franchise agreement for a new location in Burlington.\xC2\xA0Franchise owners Carrie and John Butera signed a development agreement to open a self-serve location next spring in the Burlington Mall.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Local and state officials, along with many local residents, came to the future Wegman's location on 3rd Avenue last week for a groundbreaking event.\xC2\xA0Though no shovels were actually put in the ground, the event was a celebration of the beginning in the next stage of the site's development. The Wegman's is planned to open in the spring of 2014.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xC2\xA0Good news for chocolate lovers.\xC2\xA0Swiss\xC2\xA0chocolatier\xC2\xA0Lindt celebrated the grand re-opening of it's Burlington location in the\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fburlington.patch.com%2flistings%2fburlington-mall\">Burlington Mall</a>.\xC2\xA0According to Lindt, the store will feature a vast array of premium chocolate offerings and Lindt \"Chocolate Advisors\" will be on hand to educate and guide customers through the store.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>The Upper Crust Pizzeria chain, including a Lexington location, has filed for bankruptcy protection after defaulting on millions of dollars in loans, according to the\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2f\">Boston Globe</a>.\xC2\xA0The embattled gourmet pizza chain was ordered by the Federal Labor officials to pay overtime to employees, and has been accused of improper use of assests for personal use by executives, and recently shut down some locations,\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwaltham.patch.com%2farticles%2fwaltham-restaurant-closes\">including the Waltham restaurant</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\

                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) &mdash; European Central Bank President Mario Draghi has warned that the economy of the 17 countries that use the euro remains weak and will struggle to grow even with &lsquo;&lsquo;visibly improved&rsquo;&rsquo; confidence among the currency union&rsquo;s financial markets.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>After the ECB&rsquo;s governing council left its key interest rate unchanged at the record low of 0.75 percent, Draghi insisted the bank has done its part to haul the eurozone out of its financial crisis. Markets have rallied since the ECB offered in September to buy the bonds of countries such as Spain and Italy, which are struggling with borrowing costs on their debt.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Draghi said it was up to governments to improve investor confidence in the currency bloc by fixing their shaky public finances and cutting the bureaucracy and regulations that block stronger growth.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Economic activity in the euro area is expected to remain weak, although it continues to be supported by our monetary policy stance and financial market confidence has visibly improved on the back of our decisions,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said at a news conference in Frankfurt.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The slack economy poses a serious risk for the eurozone because only a broad rebound will help shrink the levels of government debt that have already pushed Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Cyprus into asking for bailouts. Government debt across the eurozone now averages 90 percent of annual economic output &mdash; well above the 60 percent limit under the region&rsquo;s fiscal rules.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Draghi said current evidence &lsquo;&lsquo;does not signal improvements toward the end of the year&rsquo;&rsquo; and that growth was suffering from &lsquo;&lsquo;heightened risk aversion,&rsquo;&rsquo; as consumers and companies seek to cut their debt and improve their finances.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>As part of its efforts to calm the financial crisis, the ECB in September said it was willing to buy bonds issued by heavily indebted countries with the aim of lowering their borrowing costs as long as they are willing to ask for the help and take steps to cut their deficits. Since then, stocks have risen and borrowing costs fallen &mdash; without the ECB spending a cent to intervene. The proposal alone appears to have helped instill greater confidence in the countries&rsquo; ability to pay down their debts.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>On Thursday, the interest rate for Spain&rsquo;s benchmark 10-year bond on the secondary market &mdash; an indicator of investor wariness of a country&rsquo;s economy &mdash; was at 5.8 percent, up marginally on recent days but still way down from the unsustainable highs of 7 percent it reached in July. Meanwhile the Stoxx 50 index of leading European shares was up 148 points to 2,527.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>While markets are feeling better, the outlook for the wider economy remains glum.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Budget cuts and tax increases imposed as part of austerity programs are weighing heavily on economies. The region&rsquo;s gross domestic product shrank 0.3 percent in the second quarter. The European Union&rsquo;s executive commission predicts it will shrink 0.4 percent this year, and, perhaps more alarmingly, grow only 0.1 percent all of next year. Unemployment is at 11.6 percent, highest the euro was introduced in 1999.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Five eurozone countries are in recession &mdash; Italy, Spain Portugal, Greece and Cyprus.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In theory, a cut to interest rates would stimulate the economy by making it easier for consumers and businesses to borrow, spend and invest. Yet low ECB rates and cheap ECB credit to banks are not getting through to the wider economy in the form of more loans. That&rsquo;s often because businesses see no reason to borrow and expand production in a slack economy.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Draghi indicated the bond purchase plan, by lowering borrowing rates in troubled countries and easing markets, was actually doing what an interest rate cut would normally do, calling it &lsquo;&lsquo;equivalent to a further expansion of monetary policy.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Analyst Christian Schulz said that the bond-purchase program &lsquo;&lsquo;has a stronger easing effect than any rate cut&rsquo;&rsquo; and that Draghi&rsquo;s insistence that the ECB is ready to use the program outweighs anything else the bank could do right now.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="">
    <p>The ECB has argued that it&rsquo;s up to countries to push ahead with so-called structural reforms &mdash; ones that make their economy more productive in the long term. Those typically include breaking down job protections for established workers so that companies can hire and fire more easily, and be more willing to higher younger workers. Spain and Greece have jobless rates of 54.2 percent and 55.6 percent respectively for people under 25.<img alt="end of story marker" border="0" height="8" width="6" src="http://www.boston.com/r/SysConfig/WebPortal/Boston/Framework/images/site_graphics/dingbat_story_end_icon.gif" class="storyend"></p>

  title: Everett in talks with Hard Rock for casino
  community_id: "38"

    <div><div id="articleFull"><p><span class="articleBegin">A</span> blighted plot of industrial land just off the Mystic River in Everett could become a gleaming waterfront casino as an international gaming giant has begun talks with the city that could yield a new, deep-pocketed player to challenge Suffolk Downs, officials told the Herald.</p>
    <p>Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria said he has had preliminary talks with representatives of Hard Rock International, as well as Chicago casino titans Rush Street Gaming, about a 40-acre waterfront site bordered by Route 99 and the Mystic River that formerly housed Monsanto Chemical Co. Hard Rock officials have met with the site owner, listed as FBT Everett realty, and spoken to the city about a possible casino resort, including a glass tower and new marina, the mayor said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited to see what plans they put forward,&rdquo; DeMaria said.</p>
    <p>Formal plans have not been made and Hard Rock &mdash; which abandoned plans to build a casino in Springfield &mdash; has not met with the Massachusetts Gaming Commission to discuss the application process.</p>
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>But DeMaria said Hard Rock officials are &ldquo;serious&rdquo; about the site, which includes a deep water port, direct access to Boston Harbor and close access to Interstate 93. Talks have included the possibility of a new ramp off I-93, as well as a new commuter rail station and water taxi service, DeMaria said.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;The site is a hidden gem,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Something good is going to happen there. I&rsquo;m anxious to look at the proposal.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>DeMaria said he also had talks with Rush Street Gaming several months ago but has not heard any more from the company, which is reportedly eyeing several Massachusetts sites. Rush Street officials formed a local arm called Massachusetts Gaming and Entertainment LLC. The company, headed by casino titan Neil Bluhm, is among several firms that met with state gaming officials in the past week.</p>
    <p>MGC spokeswoman Elaine Driscoll said Hard Rock hasn&rsquo;t contacted the board, adding, &ldquo;We&rsquo;d welcome any new developers that may come forward.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Herald reported last week that two Springfield developers were furious that MGC Chairman Stephen Crosby, seeking competition in Boston, urged Hard Rock to consider the Boston area, where Suffolk Downs is seen as the odds-on favorite to land a casino license. Hard Rock and Rush Street officials did not respond to requests for comment, but both companies are reportedly interested in a Bay State casino deal.</p>
    <p>DeMaria was confident Everett voters would back a casino, if the deal includes guaranteed jobs for residents and ample tax revenue for the city. &ldquo;I think the people of Everett would probably say yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why not us?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>To the Editor,</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>For the past 15 years the Wayland Community Fund has helped Wayland residents in financial need by providing assistance with utility payments, rent, food, medical and other expenses. Last November, when we were concerned that we would run out of funds long before the end of our fiscal year, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwayland.patch.com%2farticles%2fas-needs-have-grown-desire-to-help-remains-strong\">we sent an appeal to every family in Wayland</a>. The response was overwhelming.\xC2\xA0 <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwayland.patch.com%2farticles%2fwayland-steps-up-to-replenish-community-fund\">Wayland residents were so generous</a> that we received enough contributions to carry us well into the following fiscal year. Those funds, plus the contributions we regularly receive from residents, should now carry us through early summer 2013. \xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>As we are no longer in the dire straits we found ourselves last year, we will not to send out an appeal this fall. No one likes to receive all those requests for contributions that arrive in mailboxes in November and December. We don\xE2\x80\x99t want to cry wolf or suggest that our demise is imminent when we now have sufficient funding for at least several months.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Fortunately, a lot of Wayland residents send regular contributions without being reminded or asked. We still rely heavily on those contributions.\xC2\xA0 \xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>During our 15 years, the WCF has provided more than $366,000 to Wayland residents. We are staffed by five volunteers and we have no administrative or operating costs. Every penny in contributions goes directly toward paying a utility bill, rent, helping with food, or other expense.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>If you are willing to help, please send a contribution to the Wayland Community Fund, Wayland Town Building, Wayland MA 01778. We have more information on the town website.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>Within hours Melanie Berger, of Mariwear, contacted LS and secured the space.\xC2\xA0 Darlene Brown, of AAA Limousine,\xC2\xA0 offered to help coordinate and Laura Grande Erb, another mom in town immediately jumped in and offered to do what she could to help.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CThis is amazing\xE2\x80\x9D said Debbie Booras-Gordenstein of Sudbury \xE2\x80\x9CPeople immediately commented on my status update and the idea to create an opportunity for everyone to help was born.\xC2\xA0 We located a charity, run by the FDNY, that was founded after 9/11 that helps the families of first responders.\xC2\xA0 There are over 1000 FDNY families that lost everything while they were responding to the horrors of this massive storm.\xE2\x80\x9D\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The event offers the opportunity to drop off unwanted household items and clothing to the LS cafeteria on Friday November 16<sup>th</sup> from 3PM until 8PM and again on Saturday morning from 7AM until the start of the sale at 9AM.\xC2\xA0 Proceeds from the sale will benefit the FDNY 9/11 Disaster Relief Fund. They plan to buy generators and fuel for families that expect to be without power for weeks to come.\xC2\xA0 Additionally a drive was formed at their request to get items in desperate need.\xC2\xA0 Booras-Gordenstein called Roche Brothers Supermarkets to ask for a donation to rent a box truck\xC2\xA0 and pay for gas to get the items to the FDNY that is collecting the items.\xC2\xA0 Roche Brothers approved the request within one hour and they are collecting the donations at Sudbury Farms in Sudbury.\xC2\xA0 Starz Salon, Starbucks and many other businesses are chipping in to help collect items and spread the word.\xC2\xA0 Items needed are:</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Ski Hats</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Gloves</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CThis is a great opportunity to clean out your house, donate monetarily, shop the sale, or buy and donate drive items. We are planning lots of fun events at the yard sale including \xE2\x80\x98a fill a bag with clothing for $20\xE2\x80\x99, a bake sale, and maybe even face painting for little ones. All we ask is that everyone spread the word!\xC2\xA0 We are also looking for a place in New York or New Jersey to donate unsold items from the yard sale\xE2\x80\x9D said Booras-Gordenstein \xE2\x80\x9CWe have a truck, we will drive it down ourselves but now just need a place to bring the left overs.\xC2\xA0 I\xE2\x80\x99m sure there are people down there that could use these things!\xE2\x80\x9D \xC2\xA0There will be a volunteer meeting on Monday Night November 12<sup>th</sup> at 7:30 PM at Starbucks in Sudbury. Everyone and anyone is welcome to attend.\xC2\xA0 High School students that donate their time will be awarded community service hours</p><p>&#13;\n\

  title: THIS NOVEMBER, GET IN SHAPE TO WARD OFF DIABETES  Fitness Experts From Get In Shape For Women Offer Tips For Preventing  and Reducing the Side Effects from Type 2 Diabetes
  community_id: "39"

  content: "<div><div><p>During American Diabetes Month, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.getinshapeforwomen.com.\">Get In Shape For Women</a> \xE2\x80\x93 a franchised women\xE2\x80\x99s fitness studio chain that offers small group personal training in a private, upscale environment \xE2\x80\x93 emphasizes the importance of physical activity and a healthy, balanced diet for controlling and preventing diabetes. Currently, 25.8 million Americans \xE2\x80\x93 8.3 percent of the population \xE2\x80\x93 suffer from diabetes, and an additional 79 million are prediabetic, meaning they have a strong likelihood of developing the condition.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Diabetes is one of the most common health conditions in the United States. It can lead to complications ranging from hypertension and blindness to stroke, heart disease, and kidney failure. While type 2 diabetes \xE2\x80\x93 the disease\xE2\x80\x99s most common form \xE2\x80\x93 is chronic and incurable, it is <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.rodale.com%2fhow-prevent-diabetes\">90 percent preventable</a> by leading a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CThe Get In Shape For Women results-oriented system focuses on a four part transformation model that includes weight training, cardio, nutrition support and accountability,\xE2\x80\x9D said Emily Kaplan, health and fitness expert and owner of Get In Shape For Women in Wayland. \xE2\x80\x9CAll of these elements are critical in combating the onset of type 2 diabetes and preventing serious health complications.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Emily Kaplan has some helpful tips for reducing your own diabetes risk. If you\xE2\x80\x99re already diabetic, these guidelines can help stave off serious health risks and even reverse your current symptoms in the long term.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ol><li><b>Develop healthy eating habits. </b>Poor diet is one of the main contributors to type 2 diabetes: sweets, sodas, and greasy, over-processed fast food and packaged snacks are not the foundation of a healthy diet, but unfortunately, they are rapidly becoming American staples. Replace your fast-food diet with one rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains (think brown rice and whole-wheat bread), lean protein like chicken and fish, beans, and low-fat dairy products. Sweets are okay in moderation, but they should be a special treat, not a regular occurrence. Get In Shape For Women recommends one \"free\" day each week for snacks and adherence to a healthy, balanced diet all other days. In addition, replace sodas and other high-calorie beverages with water, tea, and other low-calorie options. In addition to being better for you, water is essential for life and can help flush out excess waste and keep your body and skin healthy. </li>&#13;\n\
    <li><b>Be active. </b>Set aside some time each day to get exercise. No, you don\xE2\x80\x99t have to be a bodybuilder or an Olympic marathoner \xE2\x80\x93 even 30 minutes of activity on a treadmill or elliptical counts as exercise! Over time, build up the length and intensity of your workout to keep your body guessing and increase the amount of calories burned: for example, after a month of brisk walking, consider adding in a few one-minute jogging intervals, or incorporate strength training into your routine. The Diabetes Prevention Program, a major study of prediabetic patients originally published in 2002, showed that just 30 minutes of activity five times a week helped prevent or delay type 2 diabetes \xE2\x80\x93 and helped patients lose weight, too.\xC2\xA0 </li>&#13;\n\
    <li><b>Maintain a healthy weight. </b>Being overweight greatly increases your risk for type 2 diabetes and related conditions including hypertension, heart disease, and stroke. To get back to a healthy weight for your height and body composition, you must burn more calories than you consume. This should be done through a combination of diet and exercise. Be wary of fad diets or programs that promise rapid, dramatic weight loss with minimal effort \xE2\x80\x93 those are not usually ideal for the long term. A good rule of thumb is to aim for losing one-half to two pounds per week, with more weight loss in your first two weeks. Use a food journal or smartphone app to track your food and calorie intake, and fit in moderate exercise on most days of the week. As always, be sure to consult with your doctor or healthcare professional before embarking on any weight-loss program.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><b>Get some R&amp;R.</b> Life is full of little stressors: between kids, work, bills, and everything else you have to manage on a daily basis, it can be hard to stay on track and develop positive habits. Find a way to de-stress: whether you become a member at Get In Shape For Women, meditate at home or just get more sleep, finding your own balance is crucial to developing \xE2\x80\x93 and sticking with \xE2\x80\x93 a new, healthier lifestyle. It can be easy to make unhealthy choices when you\xE2\x80\x99re always in a rush. By taking a moment to stop and think, it will be easier to stay focused on your long-term goals. </li>&#13;\n\

    <p>Well, many of you were quite gracious to Nstar when it came to how well the utility responded to Hurricane Sandy ... but many of you think there's still a LONG way to go.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Last week, <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwayland.patch.com%2farticles%2fweekly-question-on-a-scale-of-1-10-rate-nstar-s-storm-response">we asked you to rate Nstar's response</a> to Hurricane Sandy on a scale of 1-10. We specifically asked you to think about this year's response in comparison to the response to major power outage events in 2011 (remember Irene and Snowtober?)</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>We received numerous comments both here on the Patch site and over on the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ffacebook.com%2fwaylandpatch">Wayland Patch page on Facebook</a>.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>The average rating: About 4 (not everyone assigned a real number, so we're fudging the average a bit, but there were more zeroes than 10s).</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>In several cases, commenters admitted that Nstar did better than last year in some parts of town, even if their home remained powerless just a bit too long.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"I give NStar a zero for service here, but high marks for service elsewhere (assuming 'elsewhere' has its power back by now)," wrote <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwayland.patch.com%2fusers%2fsusan-koffman">Susan Koffman</a>. She added that her section of Sherman's Bridge Road didn't receive power until some time between 12:30 p.m. and 4 p.m. on Thursday (three days after Sandy struck).</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwayland.patch.com%2fusers%2fwaylandres">WaylandRes</a> had a better experience, especially as compared to being without power for four days last year.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"I would give NSTAR rate = 10," WaylandRes wrote. "We lost power but got it back within 12  hours. Pat Scully from NSTAR called me twice after I got power back on  but he wanted to doublecheck since he noticed that all my lights were  off. I appreciated his call and NSTAR's responsiveness."</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>While WaylandRes praised Nstar's customer service, <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwayland.patch.com%2fusers%2fanother-wayland-resident">Another Wayland Resident </a>was not so pleased.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><blockquote>&#13;
    <p>"I also would rate NSTAR a big fat 0.  This is the 4th time in 13 months  that we have lost power for over 48 hours.  I saw an NSTAR employee late  Tues. night and he laughed at me when I asked him how long he thought it  would take and told me that they will fix it one day.  We received no  phone call throughout these last 4 days. It just got restored in the  last hour [comment posted Nov. 1, 4:50 p.m.] but no phone call from NSTAR to inform us of anything.  Purely  the worst service I have ever seen from a company in my life!!!!!"</p>&#13;
    </blockquote><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Clearly, power restoration following Hurricane Sandy was a polarizing event for folks in Wayland. There were only a few comments that fell anywhere in the middle of the scale.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>One was that of <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwakefield.patch.com%2fusers%2frev-maddie-sifantus">Rev Maddie Sinfantus</a>, who gave Nstar a 7, "mostly because it was a vast improvement over the two  storms last year when were out one week both times."</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>For Nstar's part, a press release delievered at 8:15 a.m. on Nov. 2 announced that the utility had restored all of its customers to normal operations. Following the October 2011 snowstorm, which began on Oct. 29 as well, <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwayland.patch.com%2farticles%2fnearly-three-dozen-wayland-residents-still-without-power">Nstar was still working to restore pockets</a> of Wayland come 8 a.m. on Nov. 3.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>That means that Nstar did manage to restore Wayland at least 24 hours earlier this year than last.</p>
    </div></div>

    </p><p><em>Please note: An earlier version of this story said Subway was\xC2\xA0giving  out free six-inch subs.

    <p>Sarah Gardner founded Yoga Reaches Out with a goal of combining her passion for yoga with her drive to help children in need.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In 2010, Yoga Reaches out held its first yogathon at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough. That one-day event drew 450 yogis to the Field House at Gillette and raised about $225,000 for  Children\xE2\x80\x99s Hospital Boston and the charity Yoga for Single Moms.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Then in 2012, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpatch.com%2fA-sMyy\">a second yogathan at Gillette</a> drew about 650 participants and raised more than $200,000 for Children's Hospital Boston and the Africa Yoga Project.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Gardner is now taking her passion for yoga and helping kids to a new level through the first Yoga Reaches Out Kids' Yogathon on Sunday, Nov. 18, at Buckingham Browne &amp; Nichols' Nicholas Athletic Center (Upper School).</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Kids' Yogathon will raise money for Horizons for Homeless Children, an organization dedicated to \"improv[ing] the lives of young children who experience homelessness and help[ing] their families to succeed,\" according to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.horizonsforhomelesschildren.org%2fAbout_Us_Mission.asp\">the website</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"It really brings the idea of Yoga Reaches Out full circle \xE2\x80\x93 it\xE2\x80\x99s kids helping kids,\" Gardner said. \"In addition to this bringing yoga to children, what this event is doing for many young children is introducing a concept of making a difference.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The yogathon serves as a fundraiser by asking each participant to raise a minimum of $50.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"This event is teaching  our children, by you participating in this  event \xE2\x80\x93 by you sending an  email to grandma and grandpa \xE2\x80\x93 it\xE2\x80\x99s a  wonderful concept for an  introduction to helping others,\" Gardner said.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The event is for children ages 3-14 and the schedule is abbreviated from an all-day event, like that of the adult yogathons, to a 1 p.m.-5 p.m. event more in line with kids' abilities.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Classes are divided into various age groups and will include a family class as well. Gardner said that all of the instructors for the day specialize in teaching yoga to kids.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Gardner said participants can register at the event itself, but can also do so in advance on the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.kintera.org%2ffaf%2fhome%2fdefault.asp%3fievent%3d1039318\">Yoga Reaches Out website</a>. The registration fee is $10 (in addition to the fundraising minimum), but a family can register multiple children for a single $10 fee by using the coupon code YROKIDS when registering online.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"I'm most excited to see their faces and to perhaps, for many, introduce yoga for the first time,\" Gardner said. \"And then to learn about different ways that they were able to fundraise and how that made them feel.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Participants will receive gift bags featuring items from sponsors including ivivva athletica, WunderSmoothie, Snikiddy, Hint Water, Fresh Feet Wipes, Skinny Pop Popcorn, Cliff Kid's Z Bars and other items.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><em>The Kids' Yogathon will take place Sunday, Nov. 18 from 1 p.m.-5 p.m. in Cambridge.</em></p>\n\

Everyone should be able to share in God\xE2\x80\x99s bounty, especially at this time of year. However, we realize there are some, who for one reason or another cannot provide the basics of family life. Individuals or families may be suffering quietly, maintaining their dignity and hoping for a better day. If so, St. Vincent\xE2\x80\x99s of St. Anselm\xE2\x80\x99s may be able to be of assistance not only in providing a great meal, but with other basics as well.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>St. Vincent\xE2\x80\x99s Society at St. Anselm\xE2\x80\x99s has a small to modest fund, which can provide a solid Thanksgiving meal, or what might make us different, other forms of financial assistance. We can provide this service throughout the course of the year, not just during holiday seasons. We are sometimes approached for help with utility bills, rent, groceries, transportation or other short-term problems that beset individuals or families. We do not hand out cash. We interview a family and pay the outstanding bill or purchase gift cards for food. If you know a family in need, please pass our number to them. We would be happy to take their call at 978-443-8981.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Most parishes in the Archdiocese of Boston have a St. Vincent de Paul Society to help those who are temporarily down on their luck. We act confidentially. We do not publish anyone\xE2\x80\x99s name. We take our mission from St. Vincent de Paul who lived in the 16<sup>th</sup> century. St. Vincent became a saint because of his dedication to the service of the poor. At St. Anselm\xE2\x80\x99s we try to follow his example and provide practical assistance to\xC2\xA0 those who may have little at important junctures in their lives. Again, please share our number, 978-443-8981.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>Paula Moyer of the Sudbury SEPAC (Special  Education Parent Advisory Council) provided an update about the group's  activities to the Sudbury Public Schools Committee during its meeting Wednesday night at the Sudbury Senior Center.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>She said future plans include sibling workshops, teacher  appreciation events and fun activities such as a family sledding party.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"We are here to be a positive support system for Sudbury families," said Moyer, who is the mother of a special needs son.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>She said the group plans to do more promotion and more outreach to parents of Sudbury's special needs kids.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"Sometimes we hear from people who are surprised that there even is a SEPAC, so we try to get the word out," Moyer said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>The Committee also heard an update on the newly established Student  Services model, which focuses on continuity, consistency, collaboration  and coherence.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"It's been very invigorating for me personally," said Special  Education Administrator Debbie Dixson about the Student Services model,  which has been in place in the Sudbury Schools for about two months.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Dixson said the number of Sudbury students who require Special  Education services range from 10 to 14 percent among the elementary and  middle schools. She said that figure is below the state average and is  consistent with previous years. Types of disabilities include autism,  hearing or vision loss, emotional, communication oR health issues.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Dixson said staffing challenges in special education included a few  resignations and some movement within the schools as some staff moved  from special to regular education. It took some time to fill those  positions, she said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"We've always said that we'll wait for the right person," she said,  emphasizing a need to hire the right individual for a position as  opposed to simply filling the position as quickly as possible. Other  challenges include finding the space and resources to develop new  programs, she said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Dixson also serves as the district's Homeless Education coordinator  to make sure that children who are homeless continue to receive the  public education they are entitled to. Dixson said homeless services are  not used frequently in Sudbury, but this year there were three families  who were eligible for the homeless program.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"We're all here for the same purpose," Dixson said. "We want to make sure that we don't miss a child."</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"I think this is really helpful, not only to see the special  education presentation, but to think about it with a unified approach,"  said Committee Chair Richard Robison.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"Everyone involved in Student Services brings tremendous skill," said Dixson.</p>

    <p>The <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwayland.patch.com%2flistings%2fwayland-fire-department\">Wayland Fire Department</a> and a quick-thinking <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwayland.patch.com%2flistings%2fwayland-country-club\">Wayland Country Club </a>employee were honored Nov. 1, when the Metropolitan Boston Emergency Medical Services Council (MBEMSC) recognized \"the many  contributions made on a daily basis by pre-hospital  and hospital  personnel involved in Emergency Medical Services,\" during its annual banquet.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In particular, Frank Leahy received the Citizen/Bystander of the Year Award, which is presented to \"an  individual who, not in their regular line of duty, performs  life-saving, limb-saving or medical techniques in a medical emergency.  They must have shown quick thinking, common sense and initiative to save  a life or reduce injury,\" according to a press release.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The press release relates that Leahy was nominated for the award by Wayland Fire Capt. Bob Dorey, who submitted the following narrative, edited for the press release, with Leahy's nomination.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><blockquote>&#13;\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9COn Tuesday afternoon, May 22, 2012, just  before 4 p.m., the Wayland Fire Department responded to a 911 call for  a golfer in cardiac arrest at the Wayland Country Club. Upon arrival I  observed Mr. Francis Leahy performing chest compressions on the  unresponsive patient in the middle of the third fairway. Fire  department personnel relieved Mr. Leahy and began caring for the  patient; continuing CPR and defibrillating the patient. PRO Ambulance  intercepted with the Wayland Fire Department Ambulance on scene and  began providing Advanced Life Support (ALS) care. The patient regained a  pulse prior to transport to MetroWest Medical Center\xE2\x80\x99s Framingham  Campus. Mr. Leahy, an employee of the golf course, came to offer  assistance. Mr. Leahy\xE2\x80\x99s quick thinking and actions undoubtedly led to  the patient\xE2\x80\x99s survival and the successful outcome of this incident. On  Aug. 23, 2012, I learned the patient survived this incident, has spoken  with Mr. Leahy, and is playing golf again!\xE2\x80\x9D</p>&#13;\n\
    </blockquote><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>The Wayland girls soccer team notched one overtime upset in the North Division 2 bracket. It took penalty kicks, but Wilmington made sure the Warriors couldn't make it two.</p><p>&#13;

  title: Wayland Stop & Shop Becomes Hub for Hurricane Sandy Donations

  content: "<div><div>\n\
    <p>It's been about 10 days since Hurricane Sandy ripped through sections of New York and New Jersey, gashing the landscape and leaving behind wounds that will heal, but with scars.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In Wayland and Sudbury, power lines and trees bore the brunt of Sandy's wrath, but those small inconveniences pale in comparison when the images of locations in Sandy's direct path cross television screens and magazines.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Wayland resident Cynthia Hill on Sunday night watched a segment of \"60 Minutes\" focused on the section of Queens, N.Y., known as Breezy Point. It's a community that Hill first encountered after 9/11, when Hill and her husband, David, traveled to a fire station in New York to  meet  some of the firefighters who lost colleagues the day of the attacks. On Sept. 11, 2001, Hill and her husband were traveling from Logan Airport themselves and boarded a plane next to one of the planes used in the attacks.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>After that day, and realizing how close they came to being passengers on one of the tragic Sept. 11 flights, Hill created a needlepoint belt for her husband and they traveled to New York where some firefighters added stitches to that belt. Hill also set out to raise money for the children of firefighters who died responding to the attacks. The Hill family's relationships with firefighters there continue to this day.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The devastating losses Hill saw in Breezy Point, a community where many of those N.Y. firefighters from her past live, broke her heart and compelled her to action.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Within 48 hours, Hill and some friends had secured the cooperation of Wayland's local emergency officials and the as-yet-unopened Wayland Town Center Stop &amp; Shop to conduct a massive supply drive that will take place from Friday, Nov. 9 through Sunday, Nov. 11.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Everybody has said yes,\" Hill said. \"I have done nothing but smile. You don\xE2\x80\x99t get very often in your life  times when you can pay back. This is a golden opportunity to pay back.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Stop &amp; Shop is donating the 40-foot truck, the driver, gas, pallets of bottled water and workers to help pack the donated supplies. What's needed now, are the donations.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Hill solicited a list of needs from her contacts at the 100 Duane Street Firehouse. The firehouse itself isn't operational right now due to storm damage, but it is still staffed. Firefighters there are working to help the surrounding community recover and they are requesting the following specific items (items marked with an asterisk are especially important):</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ul><li>Space heaters</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Hose* (all sizes)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Screw guns  (cordless)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Wheelbarrows*</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Generators</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Electric cords* (50-foot &amp;  100-foot lengths)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Shovels*</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Bleach*</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Contractor  bags*</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Antifreeze</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Rubber boots (the kind that slip over regular  shoes)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Work gloves* (M, L and XL)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Hooded sweatshirts (L, XL and  XXL)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Multi-roll packages of toilet paper\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0 </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Baby wipes </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Adult diapers</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Feminine products</li>&#13;\n\
    </ul><p>Hill is also requesting warm, like-new clothing for men, women and children as well as non-perishable, grab-and-go foods that don't require water to prepare -- items such as granola bars, fruit cups, pre-made tuna salad in sealed pouches, cheese and crackers, Spam and more. Avoid brinign items with nuts or crushable items like chips.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"And let\xE2\x80\x99s not forget the children,\" Hill added, suggesting items such as jump ropes, board games or hulahoops. \"Think of your own children\xE2\x80\x99s most basic needs.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Suzi Robinson a spokeswoman with Stop &amp; Shop said the grocery chain was thrilled to be able to help when approached about the Breezy Point Project.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"We\xE2\x80\x99ve been so appreciative of the response and reception in the town,\" Robinson said. \"There have been folks that are so excited about us opening up. We certainly want to do everything that we can to show the community that we\xE2\x80\x99re there for them.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><em><strong>Donations can be dropped off at the Wayland Stop &amp; Shop</strong><b> from 10 a.m.-3 p.m. beginning Friday, Nov. 9</b><strong>. The final day to drop off items is Sunday. The truck will head to New York on Tuesday.</strong></em></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Contact Cynthia Hill at 508-358-5695 with any questions.</p>\n\

    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; Democrats in the New Hampshire Senate unanimously chose Concord Sen. Sylvia Larsen on Friday to continue as their leader.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Larsen, who is entering her 10th term, has been the chamber&rsquo;s Democratic leader for the last two years. She served as Senate president for four years before Republicans regained control of the chamber in 2010.</p>

    <p>Republicans lost six seats in Tuesday&rsquo;s election, but maintain a 13-11 margin, which means Senate President Peter Bragdon, the pick of the GOP caucus, is likely to continue as president.</p>

  content: "<div><div><p>What! You\xE2\x80\x99re not participating in a road race for Thanksgiving? Weren\xE2\x80\x99t you aware Thanksgiving is THE busiest day for road racing during the fall in the state?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Well, lucky for you, SMILE Mass is here to more than meet your needs. Smile Mass is a 501(c)3 nonprofit raising money to supply 100 Mobi-Chair beach wheelchairs to communities on Cape Cod (20 already donated this summer) so disabled children and adults can fully enjoy in a day at the beach. Now you can participate along with the rest of the road racing world in a race in November so others can have fun at the beach in the summer. Go to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fsudbury.patch.com%2fannouncements%2fmailto%3asmilemass.org\">smilemass.org</a> for more information about all our activities.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>On Saturday, November 17<sup>th</sup> the first \xE2\x80\x9CGobble Wobble for SMILE Mass\xE2\x80\x9D races (a 5K walk/run and a kids fun run) will be held at Curtis Middle School. Registration will begin at 9:00 AM for all racers and the 5K will start at 10:00 AM followed by the fun run at 10:45 AM.\xC2\xA0 The registration<br>fees are $25 for the 5K and $10 for the kids fun run (up to age 13). You may register through <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fsudbury.patch.com%2fannouncements%2fmailto%3aFastTrackTiming.com\">FastTrackTiming.com</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The suggestion for the race (and its timing) came from two Sudbury mothers, Stephanie Carlin and\xC2\xA0 Stephanie Wood LaFond, who became friends after the birth of their second children. Stephanie Carlin had been a member of her high school track team but had gotten away from running in the<br>intervening years. When she took it up again she found running made space in her day for herself and helped relieve stress. As the parent of a son with a disability, she felt combining running and raising funds for an\xC2\xA0 organization with the goals of SMILE Mass was a perfect match.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CFall, and specifically Thanksgiving, is such a wonderful time for a race that on Thanksgiving Day itself the companies needed to organize and time runners were completely booked so we needed to schedule the race for the prior Saturday. I run five days a week and I wish I could distribute Gobble Wobble for SMILE Mass Race flyers<br>to all the others runners I come in contact with each day. I want to let them know this race is the perfect distance for runners of all abilities, has a component so children in the family can compete in their own fun run, and then they can join with non-runners in the family to enjoy the family fun day festivities in the school cafeteria - There will be activities for the kids, snacks, drinks and a vendor fair where everyone can get a head start on their holiday shopping. SMILE Mass is such a worthy cause I hope everyone will come out and discover the enjoyment of participating in this easy to accomplish distance while enjoying the invigorating fall weather.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>For further information about the race, you may go to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fsudbury.patch.com%2fannouncements%2fmailto%3asmilemass.org%2f5k-race\">smilemass.org/5k-race</a>\xC2\xA0or e-mail either race organizer directly: Stephanie Carlin at <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fsudbury.patch.com%2fannouncements%2fmailto%3astephaniec%40smilemass.org\">stephaniec@smilemass.org</a><br>and Stephanie Wood LaFond at <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fsudbury.patch.com%2fannouncements%2fmailto%3astephaniel%40smilemass.org\">stephaniel@smilemass.org</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xC2\xA0So relax, Smile Mass has ensured you won\xE2\x80\x99t miss out on the opportunity to participate in the tradition of road racing during Thanksgiving. All we ask in return is you register today and to those non-runners, you can either come to the Gobble Wobble Family Fun Day festivities or get your checkbook out and make a contribution to SMILE Mass - Smile Mass, 66 Dudley Road, Sudbury, MA 01776.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In the spirit of the season, Thanks!</p></div></div>"

  content: "<div><div><p>Leslie John Bowen, 60, of Concord, passed away on Sunday, November 4, 2012, at his home surrounded by his loved ones, following a courageous battle with pancreatic <br>cancer. He was the beloved husband of 32 years of Carol (Whiting) Bowen and the loving father of Stephanie and Kimberly Bowen. Born in Nantwich, England, on <br>July 16, 1952, he was the son of the late William John Bowen and May (Williamson) Bowen.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Les attended Edleston Road Primary School and The Crewe Grammar School for Boys, both in Crewe, England. At Crewe Grammar, he cemented his lifelong love and <br>curiosity for science and technology. A teacher there recognized his talent in these areas and strongly encouraged him to pursue a career in this field, advice <br>from which he never wavered. Les attended Leeds University in Leeds, England, first earning a Bachelor of Science in 1973 and then a Ph.D. in Materials <br>Science and Ceramics in 1977. Later that year, he began <br>postdoctoral research at the Materials Research Laboratory at The Pennsylvania State University in State College, PA, contributing to the development of piezocomposite materials and other acoustic transducer technologies. It was at Penn State that he met his wife Carol, a <br>Ph.D. student at the time, when he accidentally crashed into her car. Following their marriage in 1980, Les and Carol moved to Massachusetts, eventually settling in Concord in 1982. From 1980 to 1991, Les worked at GTE <br>Laboratories in Waltham, MA, where his research focused on electronic ceramics and devices. In 1984, he became Manager of Ceramics R&amp;D, overseeing research <br>into structural and optical ceramics.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In 1991, Les left GTE to found Material Systems Inc. (MSI), a high technology manufacturing company with 40 employees in Littleton, MA which develops and manufactures sub-systems, components, and advanced materials for defense and commercial systems customers. <br>Les held numerous U.S. and foreign patents and he coauthored over 30 publications in the materials, science, and business fields.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Les believed passionately in the value and power of small business, and was proud of his role as an entrepreneur and small business advocate. He was a leader in the small business community both in New England as well as nationally as a long-time member of the Smaller Business Association of New England (SBANE) and the National Small Business Association (NSBA) boards of directors. He relished working with other small business owners and never hesitated to help them, providing resources, valuable counsel and guidance wherever he could. Additionally, he frequently worked with congressional leaders in Washington, providing information, guidance and advocacy on issues impacting small businesses, and was appointed to the President's Export Council Subcommittee on <br>Export Administration (PECSEA).</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Les received numerous awards in his career, but was particularly proud of receiving the American Ceramic Society\xE2\x80\x99s F.H. Norton Award in 1998, being named the NSBA\xE2\x80\x99s Champion of Small Business Innovation in February 2012, receiving the Raytheon\xC2\xA0 Integrated Defense Systems Freedom Award in May 2012, and being the first <br>recipient of SBANE\xE2\x80\x99s Herbert L. Spivack Entrepreneurial Excellence Award in October, 2012.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Outside of work, Les loved playing golf, hiking, camping, swimming, as well as building, fixing, and repairing things and teaching these skills to his daughters of whom <br>he was so proud. Les was also curious about the world, and traveled frequently with his family to places as far-reaching as Australia, Japan, South America, and Eastern Europe. By the time he passed away, he had been to 49 out of the 50 states in the US. He also loved spending time with Carol in Sarasota, Florida at their home there, and taking long walks along the beach. He had a great passion <br>for craft beer and grilling, which he excelled at, sometimes venturing out in the snow to grill delicious steaks in the middle of winter.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Les was a truly unique man who inspired everyone he met. His intrepid spirit, keen insight, warm and approachable manner, sense of humor, and thoughtful outlook on <br>life will be sorely missed by all the people and communities he touched.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>He is survived by two sisters, including Christine Gilchrist of Crewe, Cheshire, England, many loving nieces and nephews, grandnieces and nephews, and mother-, <br>sister- and brothers-in-law.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A funeral service and celebration of his life was held on Sunday, November 11th at Trinity Episcopal Church in Concord.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In lieu of flowers, contributions in his memory may be made to either of two causes that were very close to his heart: the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Research Fund at <br>Johns Hopkins Children\xE2\x80\x99s Center or to Emerson Hospital.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Funeral arrangements were\xC2\xA0under the care of Dee Funeral Home of Concord, Susan M. Dee &amp; Charles W. Dee, Jr., Funeral Directors.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>On Sunday, Nov. 11 at 2 p.m., the town will observe <strong>Veterans Day</strong> with a parade and flag disposal ceremony from the Pritchard Gate of Sleepy Hollow Cemetery. Town offices will be closed on Monday, Nov. 12 in observance of the holiday.</p>\n\n\
    <p>On Monday, Nov. 12 at 8 a.m. the <strong>Community Preservation Committee</strong> is making a site visit to McGrath Farm, 449 Barretts Mill Road.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The <strong>Concord-Carlisle School Committee</strong> meets on Tuesday, Nov. 13 at 6:30 p.m. at the high school. Among the items on the agenda are votes to approve an expedition trip to Bolivia and France, as well as a report from a teacher and students about a Tanzania expedition trip. Another agenda item is FY14 budget development.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The <strong>Planning Board</strong> meets on Tuesday, Nov. 13 at 7 p.m. at 141 Keyes Road. The board will consider a recommendation to the Board of Appeals for site plan approval and special permit for changing a gas station at 1117 Main Street into a financial office.</p>\n\n\
    <p>On Wednesday, Nov. 14 at 6 p.m. at 141 Keyes Road, the Planning Board, Historic Districts Commission, Natural Resources, Historical, and Public Works commissions are meeting for a design session about <strong>Millbrook Tarry</strong>.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Concord Players present \xC2\x93<strong>Mister Roberts</strong>\xC2\x94 until Nov. 17. Visit <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.concordplayers.org%2f\">here </a>for ticket information. In this 1948 Tony Award-winning classic, a restless crew aboard a cargo vessel idling in the South Pacific is desperately craving some onshore action. When the comedic ensemble clashes with their tyrannical captain, it is Mister Roberts who must bail them out. Thomas Heggen and Joshua Logan's moving, yet humorous story of an officer, who sacrifices his personal quest for the morale of his crew, has us reflecting on one man's search for purpose during a time of war.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Take in the new exhibit by <strong>Armin Musham</strong> at the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.albrightartgallery.com\">Albright Gallery</a>, 32 Main St., through Nov. 4. Thinking about the holidays? The gallery is hosting \xC2\x93Give Art\xC2\x94 from Nov. 6 to Jan. 6, 2013. It is a special exhibit of well-priced original art for holiday giving. Your gift helps local artists as well as offers unique gift-giving. Opening reception is Nov. 8 from 6 to 8 p.m.  </p>\n\n\
    <p>The <strong>Council on Aging</strong> will be doing a Winterization Program with Concord Academy on Nov. 17. Concord Academy has chosen to fulfill its commitment to community service by working with Concord senior citizens. 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. They will clean up leaves, install plastic or storm windows, apply weather stripping to doors, clean out and safety-check basements, replace smoke detector batteries, as well as do minor repairs all in preparation for winter. Please call the COA to get on the list before Nov. 13.</p>\n\n\
    <p>View the new exhibit at the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.concordart.org%2f\">Concord Art Association</a>, 37 Lexington Rd., for its new exhibit that runs through Nov. 18. <strong>It is about art and food.</strong> This exhibit brings together artists who work in a variety of media and materials - including edible ones \xC2\x96 to express a range of intentions. Some artists use food imagery as a metaphor for human relations and society\xC2\x92s challenges, others to celebrate memory, while others delve into the complexities of the structure of food itself \xC2\x96 exploring line, color, pattern, and space. In conjunction with this exhibit, Concord Art Association will be collecting donations of canned goods for <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fopentable.org%2f\">Open Table</a> through Nov. 18.</p>\n\n\
    <p>And at the <strong>Emerson Umbrella</strong>, be sure to catch an exhibit featuring Kayo Burmon, resident artist at the Umbrella, with \"a collection of very diverse works created over the last few years,\" Burmon explains. \"Sleepless nights are common among artists. It is no wonder. Days are replete with action, colors, patterns, images, shapes, sounds, emotions, light and dark, people, stories, news, illness, birth, death, experiences-both painful and pleasant, nature\xC2\x92s best and worst\xC2\x85. To distill all this in a way that can be translated into a work of art is an enigma. The result? Sleepless nights.\" Free.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The <strong>Concord Museum</strong> has a new exhibit, \xC2\x93<em>The Greatest Source of Wealth: Agriculture in Concord</em>,\xC2\x94 in the Wallace Kane Gallery through March 17, 2013. </p>\n\n\
    <p>The <strong>library </strong>has an agricultural exhibit in conjunction with the Museum. Visit 129 Main Street to take it in. The display is part of a collaborative focus on farming between the library, the Concord Museum, and ConcordCAN.  </p>\n\n\
    <p>Project Bread has awarded $78,000 to MetroWest food programs including <strong>Concord\xC2\x92s Open Table</strong>. Peter Hilton, president of Open Table, explains how the grant from Project Bread helps his pantry: \xC2\x93Open Table depends on Project Bread and others for the support we need to provide healthy food to our guests at our Concord and Maynard locations. Our guest population has continually grown over the last several years, and it can be challenging to keep up with this demand.\xC2\x94</p>\n\n\

    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; Democrats in the New Hampshire Senate unanimously chose Concord Sen. Sylvia Larsen on Friday to continue as their leader.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Larsen, who is entering her 10th term, has been the chamber&rsquo;s Democratic leader for the last two years. She served as Senate president for four years before Republicans regained control of the chamber in 2010.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Republicans lost six seats in Tuesday&rsquo;s election, but maintain a 13-11 margin, which means Senate President Peter Bragdon, the pick of the GOP caucus, is likely to continue as president.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Bragdon, 49, of Milford, is entering his fifth term in the Senate.</p>

    <p>The House and Senate vote on leaders Dec. 5, after the newly elected lawmakers are sworn in.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>House Republicans caucus to nominate a House speaker candidate Thursday. House Democrats make their selection Nov. 17. House Democrats regained control of the chamber in Tuesday&rsquo;s election with a 222-178 edge, though the final margin could change after contested results are recounted. House Democrats currently have 102 members.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Larsen, 63, said she was honored to have the opportunity to lead Senate Democrats.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;There is a renewed sense of optimism in New Hampshire and the message from voters is clear. People want a return to a common-sense, civil approach to problem-solving,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said in a statement.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Larsen said among her top priorities is taking another look at New Hampshire&rsquo;s new law requiring photo identification to vote. Next year, acceptable identification is narrowed and made much more restrictive, she said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Larsen also wants to see if some of the funding to public colleges cut by the outgoing Republican Legislature can be restored. She also wants to see if aid to hospitals can be increased.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>During her years in the Senate, Larson was the prime sponsor of a tax-free college tuition savings plan called the Unique Plan. She also has sponsored laws establishing a land conservation program, a subsidized insurance for children and on workforce housing. She has co-sponsored bills to raise the high school dropout age, establish a research and development tax credit for business and to reinstate a job training fund.</p>

    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;re ready to get to work with our new Governor-elect Maggie Hassan and Democrats and Republicans in both chambers to strengthen our economy, create jobs and continue to make New Hampshire the best state in the nation to live and raise a family,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said.<img alt="end of story marker" border="0" height="8" width="6" src="http://www.boston.com/r/SysConfig/WebPortal/Boston/Framework/images/site_graphics/dingbat_story_end_icon.gif" class="storyend"></p>

    <span>U.S. Federal District Court Judge David Dowd on Friday\n\
    approved a settlement between the Akron Beacon Journal and Guild and Composing\n\
    retirees over retirement-day healthcare benefits that the BJ changed later that\n\
    could cost the newspaper millions of dollars.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\

    from the BJ&#8217;s liability insurance company &nbsp;to the attorneys for Dave and Gina White, et\n\
    al and John Olesky, et al to cover the plaintiffs&#8217; expenses for the suits, which\n\
    were filed in 2009 and 2010.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    </div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    <span>All that&#8217;s left is for BJ Settlement Administrator Roger\n\
    Wettmore to handle the reimbursement claims for extra medical and prescription\n\
    expenses caused by the Beacon&#8217;s shifts in coverage and Jan. 1 implementation of the restored coverage.</span></div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    </div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    <span>The $100,000 set aside for\n\
    this purpose is expected to cover the payments, minus\n\
    the $16,511 reimbursed for retired printers named in their lawsuit after a 2009\n\
    injunction by Judge Dowd. If not, the reimbursements would be pro-rated.\n\
    <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    </div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    <span>On Jan. 1, 2013 the printers and Guild retirees included\n\
    in the settlement will revert to their $2 (Guild) and $5 (printers) co-pays for\n\
    prescriptions and will be covered medically under Plan N, which should give the\n\
    printers and Guild retirees coverage equal to or better than their retirement-day\n\
    coverage.&nbsp;</span><span>This will save some retirees\n\
    thousands of dollars a year compared to the current BJ coverage under Aetna.&nbsp;</span></div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    </div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    <span>Eligible retirees will\n\
    be enrolled with United Healthcare for AARP Medicare Supplement Plan N and\n\
    Medical Mutual of Ohio for the $2 and $5 prescription co-pays. The Beacon\n\
    Journal will pay all the premiums.</span></div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    </div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    <span>Based\n\
    on 2012 information, retirees will pay at least a $140 annual deductible for\n\
    medical care although that could change upward in 2013. &nbsp;</span></div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    </div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    <span>Dave and Gina White started this process by putting up\n\
    $2,500 of their money. Because John Olesky was the only Guild retiree to file a\n\
    lawsuit, in 2010, that made Guild retirees also eligible for the settlement.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    </div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    <span>In addition to the Whites, the named plaintiffs are retired\n\
    printers Hugh and Sharon Downing, Ruth and Tom West, Bob Abbott, Bob Walker,\n\
    Larnie and Stephanie Greene, Ora and Shirley Thombs, Ray and Amy Wolfe and Norm\n\
    and Naomi Mattern.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    </div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    <span>The process began in\n\
    2005 when Dave White and Siesta Key, Florida Island House Condominium owner Lou\n\
    Smith, who had become friends, discussed the BJ reneging on healthcare\n\
    coverage. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    <br></div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    <span>Smith referred White to\n\
    Allen G. Anderson of his Smith &amp; Johnson law firm in Traverse City,\n\
    Michigan. Anderson got Chandra Law Firm of Cleveland involved because the\n\
    plaintiffs needed Ohio representation.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    <br></div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    <span>Attorneys for the plaintiffs are the Chandra Law Firm under Subodh\n\
    Chandra with lawsuit point-man Don Screen, and Anderson and Kenneth M.\n\
    Petterson of Smith &amp; Johnson in Traverse City. Screen, Anderson and\n\
    Petterson were in Judge Dowd&#8217;s court Friday, with retired printer Ruth West and\n\
    husband Tom West and John Olesky witnessing the historic settlement. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    </div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    <span>The Beacon had three attorneys,\n\
    including Brett Bacon and </span><span>Colleen C. Murnane, outside\n\
    counsel from the Cleveland law firm of Frantz Ward, and Beacon Journal\n\
    Settlement Administrator Roger Wettmore, who has been at the BJ for 32 years,\n\
    at its table. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    </div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    <span>In early 2007, shortly after\n\
    Canadian media mogul David Black's company acquired the Beacon Journal, the\n\
    newspaper switched health-insurance plans and drastically reduced these\n\
    retirees' benefits even more.&nbsp;</span></div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    </div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    <span>The resentment built into the lawsuit filed in\n\
    2009. Later that year, Judge Dowd filed a temporary injunction requiring the BJ\n\
    to restore $5 prescription benefits to retired printers named in the lawsuit. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    </div>\n\
    <div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\
    <span>Guild retirees eligible for the\n\
    settlement, which depended on the wording in retirement letters, are Olesky, of\n\

    <p>The Concord-Carlisle boys' soccer team topped Pentucket, 4-0, Saturday afternoon, in an MIAA Division 2 North semifinal matchup in Woburn.</p>
    
    <p>The match started evenly with both teams trading chances. But as the half progressed the Sachems (16-3-2) struggled to keep the pace.</p>
    
    <p>The Patriots (13-2-2) offense opened up the scoring with Stowe Simonton heading a cross from a corner kick into the net. </p>
    
    <p>&#147;That was just about as solid as we played all year in the first half,&#148; said Patriot coach Ray Pavlik. &#147;I&#146;m pleased, we came out we really moved the ball well today.&#148;</p>
    
    <p>The Patriot offense struck again following a beautifully executed passing play that ended with Wyatt Powell burying a one-timer just inside the box. </p>
    
    <p>The Patriots never let up on the attack. Simonton found the back of the net again following a beautiful pass to send him in alone on the goal keeper. </p>
    
    <p>The first half concluded with another Patriot goal. Leo Fondriest buried a shot from the top of the 18 after a failed Sachems attempt to clear the ball. </p>
    
    <p>&#147;We were able to put a lot of pressure on the midfield,&#148; Pavlik said. &#147;The passing really opened things up well today, we really moved the ball quickly.&#148;</p>
    
    <p>&#147;It was nice win, we finally got a lot of our starting line up back together, and they have had a couple of games to play together, its really clicked,&#148; said Pavlik.</p>
    
    <p>Up next for the Patriots is North Andover in the final.</p>
    
    <p>We&#146;re going to stay and watch,&#148; Pavlik said. &#147;They&#146;re two good teams, and at this time of year every match is huge.&#148; &#147;Whether we play North-Andover or Wilmington, it will take a big effort on our part.&#148;<br>

  content: "<div><div><p>In the aftermath of this year\xE2\x80\x99s contentious and closely fought national elections, Arlington Community Education will host <strong>What Now?\xC2\xA0A Post-Election Roundtable</strong> with specialists in American politics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Tufts University. The program will take place at <strong>7:30pm on Thursday, November 15</strong>, in the Arlington High School Media Center, 869 Mass Ave, Arlington. The event is co-sponsored by the League of Women Voters of Arlington.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Panelists include MIT professor Andrea Campbell, whose upcoming book is <i>How Americans Think About Taxes</i>; Devin Caughey, who has been teaching a US National Elections class at MIT this fall; and Debbie Schildkraut, associate professor at Tufts University and author most recently of <i>Americanism in the Twenty-First Century: Pubic Opinion in the Age of Immigration</i>. The program will be moderated by David Whitford, an editor-at-large at <i>Fortune</i> magazine.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Panelists will examine the ways in which President Obama\xE2\x80\x99s victory and the congressional and ballot initiative outcomes were both surprising and unsurprising; how voters' attitudes toward health care reform and their attributions of credit and blame for the economy\xE2\x80\x93 including their views on the auto and bank bailouts and the stimulus measures \xE2\x80\x93 affected voter choice; and, finally, whether the public is as polarized as are elected politicians, and how this reality bodes for policymaking during Obama's second term.\xC2\xA0There will be ample opportunity for questions from the audience.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>This program is the second in Arlington Community Education\xE2\x80\x99s fall speaker series moderated by David Whitford and co-sponsored by the League of Women Voters of Arlington. The final event in the series <strong>Making Evidence Matter: The Role of Science in US Policy</strong> will take place on Thursday, November 29, at 7:30pm, and will feature Kevin Knobloch, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Admission is $5. For more information visit www.arlingtoncommunityed.org or call\xC2\xA0the Community Education office at 781 316-3568.</p></div></div>"

    <p><br>Throngs of Somerville residents came out to vote Tuesday, and lines at some polling locations were over an hour long for much of the day. In local races, Question 4 passed, meaning Somerville has decided to adopt the Community Preservation Act. State Reps Timothy Toomey and Carl Sciortino won reelection to the state House of Representatives.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><br>A Nov. 3 fire at 84 Wheatland St. displaced six people and caused about $50,000 of damage. The fire was accidental and was caused by an electrical malfunction, according to the Somerville Fire Department.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><br>We learned this week that Somerville Police arrested on Nov. 2 a Somerville woman accused of robbing the Citizens Bank in Union Square on Oct. 30. Police made the arrest after receiving a tip, staking out the suspect's apartment and finding stained clothes in her trash that appear to have been caused by an exploded dye pack.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><br>A nor'easter brought wind and snow to Somerville Wednesday night, about a week and a half after Hurricane Sandy hit the Boston area. There was enough snow that snow plows patrolled the streets, and someone built a snow throne in a Davis Square park.</p><p>&#13;

    <p>Both Thayrone Miranda and Felix De Bona scored two goals and had an assist for the Highlanders (19-0-2). Miranda&rsquo;s first goal and both of De Bona&rsquo;s goals came off headers.</p>\n\
    <p>&ldquo;Felix speaks for himself by the way he plays,&rdquo; Somerville coach George Scarpelli said. &ldquo;Felix finishes and that is just the way he plays. He did exactly what we needed from him tonight, and that is to score goals.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\
    <p>Somerville did have some nerves coming into the game because it had already beaten Madison Park (17-4) earlier this season.</p>\n\
    <p>&ldquo;You have to be nervous playing a team like Madison Park because they are just that talented,&rdquo; Scarpelli said. &ldquo;You never know what kind of motivation they could have before the game.&rdquo;</p>\n\
    <p>After Miranda headed in a goal to give Somerville an early 1-0 lead, Madison Park&rsquo;s Edmilson Barros converted a penalty kick to tie the score.</p>\n\
    <p>Unfortunately for the Cardinals, moments later De Bona nailed in a header to put Somerville back on top.</p>\n\
    <p>&ldquo;I was kind of lucky because I wasn&rsquo;t even facing the goal,&rdquo; De Bona said. &ldquo;I got a nice pass from Julian Murphy and I was just able to put it in.&rdquo;</p>\n\
    <p>De Bona added another goal in the 53rd minute, and then fed Francisco Fernandes Neto on a 2-on-1 play to push the lead to 4-1.</p>\n\
    <p>Miranda iced the game with a breakaway goal, beating Madison Park goalie Joao Rosa to add some insurance with just over five minutes remaining.</p>\n\
    <p>Somerville will play <b>St. John&rsquo;s Prep</b> in the Division 1 North final tomorrow (noon) at Manning Field in Lynn, after Carter Ocko scored off a header with 4:08 remaining to lift the No.\xE2\x80\x89\xE2\x80\x894 Eagles (17-1-2) to a 2-1 victory over top-seeded <b>Masconomet</b> (18-1-2).</p>\n\
    <p>Girls soccer</p>\n\
    <p>Caitlin Harty scored in the first half to give No.\xE2\x80\x894 <b>Beverly</b> (17-3-0) the 1-0 win over No.\xE2\x80\x899 <b>Westford Academy</b> (12-5-1) in the Div. 1 North semifinals.</p>\n\
    <p>In the Div. 2 South semifinals, Cami McCrudy scored a hat trick as No.\xE2\x80\x893 <b>Medfield</b> (18-0-3) defeated No\xE2\x80\x897 <b>East Bridgewater</b> (14-2-4), 4-1.</p>\n\
    <p>The Warriors will face No.\xE2\x80\x898 <b>Duxbury</b> in the final Monday (noon) at Taunton High, after the Dragons (16-2-4) beat No.\xE2\x80\x894 <b>Canton</b> (16-2-1) in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 tie.</p>\n\
    <p>Jackie Goudreault scored the game&rsquo;s lone goal off an assist from Abigail Bridgewhile, and keeper Julia Perlmutter recorded seven saves on her way to a shutout as No.\xE2\x80\x895 <b>Dover-Sherborn </b>(15-3-3) edged No.\xE2\x80\x8917 <b>Abington </b>(12-8-1), 1-0 in the Div. 3 South semifinals.</p>\n\

The Somerville Transportation Director and Ward 2 Alderman will be presenting the latest design proposal.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the issues that has sparked some controversy about this project is the removal of all parking on the even-side of the street from Oxford to Washington St. to&nbsp;accommodate&nbsp;the installation of 7&#39; cycletracks. This will be 111 parking spaces that will be permanently removed and could cause serious issues for&nbsp;businesses&nbsp;and residents in the area. Part of the reason for&nbsp;removing&nbsp;this much park was on the basis of a parking study conducted on 3 days this year: &nbsp;May 19th, May 23rd, and June 19th.</p><br></div></div>"

    <p>The case surrounding the attempted carjacking on Oct. 24 in Wayland continues to grow and spread out.</p><p>&#13;

Leblanc's is the third arrest warrant issued in this case. <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwayland.patch.com%2farticles%2fwayland-police-arrest-suspect-in-attempted-carjacking">Elias Breit</a>, formerly of Wayland, but now homeless, and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwayland.patch.com%2farticles%2fwayland-police-arrest-second-suspect-in-attempted-carjacking">John Abbott</a>, of Wayland, have already been arrested in connection to the case.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>According to police, they <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwayland.patch.com%2farticles%2fwayland-police-looking-for-two-suspects-in-carjacking">responded to a call on the evening of Oct. 24</a> about a fight in progress on Edgewood Road in Cochituate. When officers arrived, the victim, a Framingham man, told them two men had entered his red Ford Ranger and attempted to carjack him at gunpoint. When he fought back, realizing the gun was fake, the suspects fled.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Now police say that Leblanc knew Breit, Abbott and the victim and called the victim to Wayland, telling him that she wanted to buy marijuana. When he arrived, however, LeBlanc was no longer in the area and, police say, Breit and Abbott then attempted to take his vehicle.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Leblanc is being charged with conspiracy to commit larceny from a person and accessory before the fact, and larceny from a person.</p>

  title: Concord-Carlisle rolls into North final

    <p>The Concord-Carlisle boys' soccer team topped Pentucket, 4-0, Saturday afternoon, in an MIAA Division 2 North semifinal matchup in Woburn.</p>
    
    <p>The match started evenly with both teams trading chances. But as the half progressed the Sachems (16-3-2) struggled to keep the pace.</p>
    
    <p>The Patriots (13-2-2) offense opened up the scoring with Stowe Simonton heading a cross from a corner kick into the net. </p>
    
    <p>&#147;That was just about as solid as we played all year in the first half,&#148; said Patriot coach Ray Pavlik. &#147;I&#146;m pleased, we came out we really moved the ball well today.&#148;</p>
    
    <p>The Patriot offense struck again following a beautifully executed passing play that ended with Wyatt Powell burying a one-timer just inside the box. </p>
    
    <p>The Patriots never let up on the attack. Simonton found the back of the net again following a beautiful pass to send him in alone on the goal keeper. </p>
    
    <p>The first half concluded with another Patriot goal. Leo Fondriest buried a shot from the top of the 18 after a failed Sachems attempt to clear the ball. </p>
    
    <p>&#147;We were able to put a lot of pressure on the midfield,&#148; Pavlik said. &#147;The passing really opened things up well today, we really moved the ball quickly.&#148;</p>
    
    <p>&#147;It was nice win, we finally got a lot of our starting line up back together, and they have had a couple of games to play together, its really clicked,&#148; said Pavlik.</p>
    
    <p>Up next for the Patriots is North Andover in the final.</p>
    
    <p>We&#146;re going to stay and watch,&#148; Pavlik said. &#147;They&#146;re two good teams, and at this time of year every match is huge.&#148; &#147;Whether we play North-Andover or Wilmington, it will take a big effort on our part.&#148;<br>

  content: "<div><div><p>Leslie John Bowen, 60, of Concord, passed away on Sunday, November 4, 2012, at his home surrounded by his loved ones, following a courageous battle with pancreatic <br>cancer. He was the beloved husband of 32 years of Carol (Whiting) Bowen and the loving father of Stephanie and Kimberly Bowen. Born in Nantwich, England, on <br>July 16, 1952, he was the son of the late William John Bowen and May (Williamson) Bowen.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Les attended Edleston Road Primary School and The Crewe Grammar School for Boys, both in Crewe, England. At Crewe Grammar, he cemented his lifelong love and <br>curiosity for science and technology. A teacher there recognized his talent in these areas and strongly encouraged him to pursue a career in this field, advice <br>from which he never wavered. Les attended Leeds University in Leeds, England, first earning a Bachelor of Science in 1973 and then a Ph.D. in Materials <br>Science and Ceramics in 1977. Later that year, he began <br>postdoctoral research at the Materials Research Laboratory at The Pennsylvania State University in State College, PA, contributing to the development of piezocomposite materials and other acoustic transducer technologies. It was at Penn State that he met his wife Carol, a <br>Ph.D. student at the time, when he accidentally crashed into her car. Following their marriage in 1980, Les and Carol moved to Massachusetts, eventually settling in Concord in 1982. From 1980 to 1991, Les worked at GTE <br>Laboratories in Waltham, MA, where his research focused on electronic ceramics and devices. In 1984, he became Manager of Ceramics R&amp;D, overseeing research <br>into structural and optical ceramics.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In 1991, Les left GTE to found Material Systems Inc. (MSI), a high technology manufacturing company with 40 employees in Littleton, MA which develops and manufactures sub-systems, components, and advanced materials for defense and commercial systems customers. <br>Les held numerous U.S. and foreign patents and he coauthored over 30 publications in the materials, science, and business fields.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Les believed passionately in the value and power of small business, and was proud of his role as an entrepreneur and small business advocate. He was a leader in the small business community both in New England as well as nationally as a long-time member of the Smaller Business Association of New England (SBANE) and the National Small Business Association (NSBA) boards of directors. He relished working with other small business owners and never hesitated to help them, providing resources, valuable counsel and guidance wherever he could. Additionally, he frequently worked with congressional leaders in Washington, providing information, guidance and advocacy on issues impacting small businesses, and was appointed to the President's Export Council Subcommittee on <br>Export Administration (PECSEA).</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Les received numerous awards in his career, but was particularly proud of receiving the American Ceramic Society\xE2\x80\x99s F.H. Norton Award in 1998, being named the NSBA\xE2\x80\x99s Champion of Small Business Innovation in February 2012, receiving the Raytheon\xC2\xA0 Integrated Defense Systems Freedom Award in May 2012, and being the first <br>recipient of SBANE\xE2\x80\x99s Herbert L. Spivack Entrepreneurial Excellence Award in October, 2012.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Outside of work, Les loved playing golf, hiking, camping, swimming, as well as building, fixing, and repairing things and teaching these skills to his daughters of whom <br>he was so proud. Les was also curious about the world, and traveled frequently with his family to places as far-reaching as Australia, Japan, South America, and Eastern Europe. By the time he passed away, he had been to 49 out of the 50 states in the US. He also loved spending time with Carol in Sarasota, Florida at their home there, and taking long walks along the beach. He had a great passion <br>for craft beer and grilling, which he excelled at, sometimes venturing out in the snow to grill delicious steaks in the middle of winter.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Les was a truly unique man who inspired everyone he met. His intrepid spirit, keen insight, warm and approachable manner, sense of humor, and thoughtful outlook on <br>life will be sorely missed by all the people and communities he touched.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>He is survived by two sisters, including Christine Gilchrist of Crewe, Cheshire, England, many loving nieces and nephews, grandnieces and nephews, and mother-, <br>sister- and brothers-in-law.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A funeral service and celebration of his life will be held on Sunday, November 11th at Trinity Episcopal Church, 81 Elm Street,\xC2\xA0Concord at 2 PM.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In lieu of flowers, contributions in his memory may be made to either of two causes that were very close to his heart: the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Research Fund at <br>Johns Hopkins Children\xE2\x80\x99s Center or to Emerson Hospital.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Funeral arrangements were\xC2\xA0under the care of Dee Funeral Home of Concord, Susan M. Dee &amp; Charles W. Dee, Jr., Funeral Directors.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>For information regarding donations in his memory, or to share a remembrance in Les\xE2\x80\x99\xC2\xA0 guest book, please visit <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2f\">www.deefuneralhome.com.</a></p></div></div>"

    <p>On Sunday, Nov. 11 at 2 p.m., the town will observe <strong>Veterans Day</strong> with a parade and flag disposal ceremony from the Pritchard Gate of Sleepy Hollow Cemetery. Town offices will be closed on Monday, Nov. 12 in observance of the holiday.</p>\n\n\
    <p>On Monday, Nov. 12 at 8 a.m. the <strong>Community Preservation Committee</strong> is making a site visit to McGrath Farm, 449 Barretts Mill Road.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The <strong>Concord-Carlisle School Committee</strong> meets on Tuesday, Nov. 13 at 6:30 p.m. at the high school. Among the items on the agenda are votes to approve an expedition trip to Bolivia and France, as well as a report from a teacher and students about a Tanzania expedition trip. Another agenda item is FY14 budget development.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The <strong>Planning Board</strong> meets on Tuesday, Nov. 13 at 7 p.m. at 141 Keyes Road. The board will consider a recommendation to the Board of Appeals for site plan approval and special permit for changing a gas station at 1117 Main Street into a financial office.</p>\n\n\
    <p>On Wednesday, Nov. 14 at 6 p.m. at 141 Keyes Road, the Planning Board, Historic Districts Commission, Natural Resources, Historical, and Public Works commissions are meeting for a design session about <strong>Millbrook Tarry</strong>.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Concord Players present \xC2\x93<strong>Mister Roberts</strong>\xC2\x94 until Nov. 17. Visit <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.concordplayers.org%2f\">here </a>for ticket information. In this 1948 Tony Award-winning classic, a restless crew aboard a cargo vessel idling in the South Pacific is desperately craving some onshore action. When the comedic ensemble clashes with their tyrannical captain, it is Mister Roberts who must bail them out. Thomas Heggen and Joshua Logan's moving, yet humorous story of an officer, who sacrifices his personal quest for the morale of his crew, has us reflecting on one man's search for purpose during a time of war.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Take in the new exhibit by <strong>Armin Musham</strong> at the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.albrightartgallery.com\">Albright Gallery</a>, 32 Main St., through Nov. 4. Thinking about the holidays? The gallery is hosting \xC2\x93Give Art\xC2\x94 from Nov. 6 to Jan. 6, 2013. It is a special exhibit of well-priced original art for holiday giving. Your gift helps local artists as well as offers unique gift-giving. Opening reception is Nov. 8 from 6 to 8 p.m.  </p>\n\n\
    <p>The <strong>Council on Aging</strong> will be doing a Winterization Program with Concord Academy on Nov. 17. Concord Academy has chosen to fulfill its commitment to community service by working with Concord senior citizens. 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. They will clean up leaves, install plastic or storm windows, apply weather stripping to doors, clean out and safety-check basements, replace smoke detector batteries, as well as do minor repairs all in preparation for winter. Please call the COA to get on the list before Nov. 13.</p>\n\n\
    <p>View the new exhibit at the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.concordart.org%2f\">Concord Art Association</a>, 37 Lexington Rd., for its new exhibit that runs through Nov. 18. <strong>It is about art and food.</strong> This exhibit brings together artists who work in a variety of media and materials - including edible ones \xC2\x96 to express a range of intentions. Some artists use food imagery as a metaphor for human relations and society\xC2\x92s challenges, others to celebrate memory, while others delve into the complexities of the structure of food itself \xC2\x96 exploring line, color, pattern, and space. In conjunction with this exhibit, Concord Art Association will be collecting donations of canned goods for <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fopentable.org%2f\">Open Table</a> through Nov. 18.</p>\n\n\
    <p>And at the <strong>Emerson Umbrella</strong>, be sure to catch an exhibit featuring Kayo Burmon, resident artist at the Umbrella, with \"a collection of very diverse works created over the last few years,\" Burmon explains. \"Sleepless nights are common among artists. It is no wonder. Days are replete with action, colors, patterns, images, shapes, sounds, emotions, light and dark, people, stories, news, illness, birth, death, experiences-both painful and pleasant, nature\xC2\x92s best and worst\xC2\x85. To distill all this in a way that can be translated into a work of art is an enigma. The result? Sleepless nights.\" Free.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The <strong>Concord Museum</strong> has a new exhibit, \xC2\x93<em>The Greatest Source of Wealth: Agriculture in Concord</em>,\xC2\x94 in the Wallace Kane Gallery through March 17, 2013. </p>\n\n\
    <p>The <strong>library </strong>has an agricultural exhibit in conjunction with the Museum. Visit 129 Main Street to take it in. The display is part of a collaborative focus on farming between the library, the Concord Museum, and ConcordCAN.  </p>\n\n\
    <p>Project Bread has awarded $78,000 to MetroWest food programs including <strong>Concord\xC2\x92s Open Table</strong>. Peter Hilton, president of Open Table, explains how the grant from Project Bread helps his pantry: \xC2\x93Open Table depends on Project Bread and others for the support we need to provide healthy food to our guests at our Concord and Maynard locations. Our guest population has continually grown over the last several years, and it can be challenging to keep up with this demand.\xC2\x94</p>\n\n\

    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; Democrats in the New Hampshire Senate unanimously chose Concord Sen. Sylvia Larsen on Friday to continue as their leader.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Larsen, who is entering her 10th term, has been the chamber&rsquo;s Democratic leader for the last two years. She served as Senate president for four years before Republicans regained control of the chamber in 2010.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Republicans lost six seats in Tuesday&rsquo;s election, but maintain a 13-11 margin, which means Senate President Peter Bragdon, the pick of the GOP caucus, is likely to continue as president.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Bragdon, 49, of Milford, is entering his fifth term in the Senate.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The House and Senate vote on leaders Dec. 5, after the newly elected lawmakers are sworn in.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>House Republicans caucus to nominate a House speaker candidate Thursday. House Democrats make their selection Nov. 17. House Democrats regained control of the chamber in Tuesday&rsquo;s election with a 222-178 edge, though the final margin could change after contested results are recounted. House Democrats currently have 102 members.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Larsen, 63, said she was honored to have the opportunity to lead Senate Democrats.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">

    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; State audits conclude that staffing shortages and inefficient management at New Hampshire&rsquo;s state prisons has cost nearly $10 million in overtime and that female inmates get fewer services than men.</p>

    <p>The Concord Monitor reports (http://bit.ly/S42kPZ) Wrenn said the Legislature has made it difficult, even impossible for him to address the problems because his budgets have been cut and money has been refused for a new women&rsquo;s prison.</p>

                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Wrenn said he&rsquo;s had difficulty controlling overtime because employee unions have fought proposed staffing and policy changes.</p>

    <p>Less than a week after wrapping the <i>Rocky Horror Show</i>, a very different production is set to open at the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2flistings%2femerson-umbrella-center-for-the-arts\">Emerson Umbrella Center for the Arts</a>: <i>Next to Normal. </i></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A Tony and Pulitzer-award winning musical that hit Broadway in 2009, features a small cast and tells the story of a suburban family struggling with a mother\xE2\x80\x99s bipolar disorder. It is, in many ways, a polar opposite to <i>Rocky Horror</i>, but Director Brian Boruta hopes the audience will feel the same level of connection \xE2\x80\x93 albeit without the squirt guns, flashlights and other props that accompanied Rocky.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CThey\xE2\x80\x99re definitely going to be in for an experience,\xE2\x80\x9D Boruta said, adding that instant connections to the story and characters produced a few tears during the cast\xE2\x80\x99s first rehearsal. \xE2\x80\x9CRegardless of what they\xE2\x80\x99re bringing in, they can expect, whether for better or for worse, to examine their own relationships when they get into their seats.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Rehearsal of <i>Next to Normal</i> actually began about a week earlier than <i>Rocky, </i>and a couple of local actors are appearing in both. So it\xE2\x80\x99s been a pretty hectic few months for Boruta, who acted in and directed <i>Rocky</i> and started his new gig as the Umbrella\xE2\x80\x99s director of performing arts in September.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Scheduling was the most difficult part of the back-to-back productions, according to Boruta, who said they designed one show to build off of another in terms of set design. For <i>Next to Normal, </i>the set design and story combine to create an experience that\xE2\x80\x99s unexpectedly intimate for a rock musical \xE2\x80\x93 even one with only six cast members.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CIt will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and by the end of it, you\xE2\x80\x99ll feel a lot lighter,\xE2\x80\x9D said Boruta. \xE2\x80\x9CThe performers are so fearless and unafraid to give themselves over to their chargers and each other, that\xE2\x80\x99s really going to translate to the audience.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The <em>Next to Normal </em>cast includes a number of local actors and even a few familiar faces, Boruta said.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Maria Wardwell will play Diana, the mother, and Randy Elkinson is Dan, the father. Joe Mullin plays Gabe, their son, and Jackie Theoharis is Natalie, their daughter. Allen Yannone portrays Henry, Natalie's boyriend, and Jonathan Barron is Dr. Fine/Dr. Madden.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>And a connection to the audience is something Boruta hopes to be a part of all the productions he\xE2\x80\x99s a part of at Emerson Umbrella.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CFor me, when I approach a production, it\xE2\x80\x99s as much about the process as the product,\xE2\x80\x9D he said, noting with <i>Next to Normal</i> he was \xE2\x80\x9Creally interested in exploring relationships the cast and crew would develop.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b><i>Next to Normal </i></b><i>opens at 8 p.m. tonight, at the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2flistings%2femerson-umbrella-center-for-the-arts\">Emerson Umbrella Center for the Arts</a>. Subsequent performances are at 8 p.m. on Nov. 10, 16, 17, 23 and 25, with 3 p.m. performances on Nov. 18 and 24. </i><em>To purchase tickets,\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ticketstage.com%2fEUCA\">click here</a>.</em></p><p>&#13;\n\

  title: Kayak's trek ends in $1.8B Priceline sale
  community_id: "34"
  url: http://pubapi.outside.in/r?url=http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/bostonherald/business/technology/~3/lwUELgqDW8Q/view.bg&publication_id=0&placement=list&region_name=Concord_MA

    <div><div id="articleFull"><p><span class="articleBegin">P</span>aul English has a pretty serious sound system at Kayak&rsquo;s offices in Concord, and it might as well be blasting &ldquo;We are the Champions&rdquo; today as the online travel site celebrates its bombshell &#36;1.8 billion acquisition by Priceline.com.</p>
    <p>Founded eight years ago by English, the chief technology officer with a passion for customer service, and Steve Hafner, the CEO, Kayak built its brand by aggregating airline, hotel and rental car data, and makes its money by referring price-comparing customers to other sites where users complete purchases.</p>
    <p>Priceline.com &mdash; an auction site built for the budget-conscious traveler and known for its wacky ads starring William Shatner of &ldquo;Star Trek&rdquo; fame &mdash; can expand in the travel advertising arena through the deal.</p>
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>Kayak also brings a distinct advantage in the mobile space, with one of the highest rated apps on iOS.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;The Priceline Group&rsquo;s global reach and expertise will accelerate our growth and help us further develop as a company,&rdquo; Hafner said in a statement.</p>
    <p>The upshot for the locally grown startup is that just four months after going public, Kayak is going to receive &#36;40 a share from Priceline, a 30 percent premium on yesterday&rsquo;s closing price &mdash; and 57 percent higher than the IPO price.</p>
    <p>The purchase price includes about &#36;500 million in cash as well as &#36;1.3 billion in equity and stock options. The companies&rsquo; boards, coincidentally both based in Norwalk, Conn., have unanimously approved the transaction, which is slated to close in the first quarter of next year subject to shareholder support.</p>
    <p>English and Hafner, with a combined 16 percent voting share as of July, will continue to run Kayak as an independent unit within Priceline.</p>
    <p>Kayak made the announcement as it reported earnings, which were 30 percent higher in the third quarter from the previous year at &#36;78.6 million.</p>
    <p>Online travel sales may hit &#36;152 billion by 2016, up from about &#36;107 billion in 2011, according to researcher eMarketer.</p>
    <p>Another Massachusetts-based online travel firm, ITA Software, was snapped up last year by Google for &#36;700 million. ITA makes flight information software.</p>

    \t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"byline\"><p class=\"byline\">By Katie Johnston, Globe Staff</p></p>\r\n\
    \t\t\t\t\t<p>Kayak Software Corp., the travel search company with offices in Concord and Norwalk, Conn., is being acquired by travel site Priceline.com Inc. for $1.8 billion in cash and stock, less than four months after becoming a publicly-traded company, the companies announced Thursday. </p>\n\
    <p>Priceline will pay $40 a share for the company, a 29 percent premium to its closing price of $31.04 Thursday and 54 percent more than its initial public offering price in July of $26 a share. </p>\n\
    <p>In a conference call with financial analysts on Thursday afternoon, Priceline chief executive officer Jeffery Boyd said the Kayak deal brings the company engineering talent and deep expertise in the increasingly important mobile market. \xE2\x80\x9CThey have a great shop up in the Boston area,\xE2\x80\x9D said Boyd, \xE2\x80\x9Cand we are very excited to be working with their engineers.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\
    <p>He said Priceline will focus on helping Kayak grow its business overseas, and further expanding into the hotel market. Kayak, which does most of its business in the United States, may also help Priceline derive more revenue from the domestic travel market.</p>\n\
    <p>Kayak reported$224 million in revenues last year, and processed 302 million users queries for travel information in the quarter ending  in September, a 31 percent jump over the same period last year.</p>\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CDomestically their [Priceline\xE2\x80\x99s] business is growing in single digits, because much of the growth is outside the US,\xE2\x80\x9D said Lorraine Sileo, a travel industry analyst at research firm PhoCusWright Inc., in Sherman, Conn. \xE2\x80\x9CThis certainly gives them a bigger chunk of the business back in the US.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\
    <p>Since it went public earlier this year, Kayak has reported strong user growth. The eight-year-old company, which had $224 million in revenues last year, processed 302 million users queries for travel information in the quarter that ended in September, a 31 percent jump over the same period last year.</p>\n\
    <p>While Americans know Priceline mainly through its humorous TV ads featuring William Shatner, the company developed a major presence overseas when it acquired the Dutch hotel booking company Booking.com in 2004. As a result, Priceline generates about 80 percent of its gross booking revenues from customers outside of the United States. </p>\n\
    <p>Adding Kayak to its portfolio will also help Priceline attract a wider segment of the market, analysts said.  Priceline has 3,400 employees and raked in $4.3 billion in revenues last year,</p>\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CThis is about expanding the size of the Priceline ranch, if you will, on the travel ecommerce prairie,\xE2\x80\x9D said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst at Atmosphere Research Group. \xE2\x80\x9CPriceline is great if you know where you want to go, or get savings. Kayak puts Priceline as a company further up the travel planning food chain in what\xE2\x80\x99s called the inspiration phase: where can I go, I only want to spend a certain amount of money.\xE2\x80\x9D </p>\n\

                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; The lawyer for a New Hampshire man seeking to reverse his conviction for the murder of a woman hacked to death with a machete and knife says jurors knew too much about the case and were emotionally influenced by the crimes. A prosecutor countered that there wasn&rsquo;t a county in the state where potential jurors hadn&rsquo;t heard of the gruesome attacks.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Public defender Stephanie Hausman argued Thursday that the state Supreme Court should order a new trial for 23-year-old Christopher Gribble of Brookline. She said the trial should have been moved out of Hillsborough County, where the 2009 Mont Vernon home invasion occurred.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Gribble is serving a life sentence without possibility of parole for killing 42-year-old Kimberly Cates and maiming her 11-year-old daughter, Jaimie. He and Steven Spader were convicted of first-degree murder and multiple other felonies.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Gribble was one of five men who broke into the Cates&rsquo; home Oct. 4, 2009.  They crept to the master bedroom, where the mother and daughter lay asleep. Gribble testified that he and Spader stood on either side of the bed in the master bedroom where the mother and daughter lay asleep. They began stabbing and slashing the two repeatedly &mdash; Spader wielding the machete and Gribble a knife. Gribble stabbed Jaimie repeatedly with the knife, then used it to slit her mother&rsquo;s throat to be sure she was dead.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Hausman argued the trial should have been moved to a different county because of the publicity about Spader&rsquo;s trial, which preceded Gribble&rsquo;s trial by a few months.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Here we have the kind of crimes that evoke visceral reactions,&rsquo;&rsquo; Hausman said. She noted that 60 percent of the jurors who decided Gribble&rsquo;s fate had been involved in discussions about the crimes before being called for jury duty.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Assistant Attorney General Peter Hinckley argued that no matter where Gribble&rsquo;s trial was held, there would be jurors who knew about the case.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;This wasn&rsquo;t just known statewide, this was a national case,&rsquo;&rsquo; Hinckley said, listing the national news organizations that covered both Gribble&rsquo;s and Spader&rsquo;s trials.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Gribble was convicted in March 2011, after a jury rejected his defense of insanity.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Hausman also challenged the admission of Gribble&rsquo;s detailed confession to a state police detective, which he gave after saying he didn&rsquo;t want to talk anymore. She told the justices the detective who recorded the confession did not &lsquo;&lsquo;scrupulous honor&rsquo;&rsquo; Gribble&rsquo;s decision to end the interrogation.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Hinckley countered that it was Gribble who instructed the detective to go and get his tape recorder, stating, &lsquo;&lsquo;I'll tell you everything.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;He went to get a tape recorder,&rsquo;&rsquo; Hinckley said of the detective. &lsquo;&lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t have a recorder because he had no expectation he (Gribble) was going to speak.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>

    <p>Hinckley said Gribble was motivated by information the detective told him they knew about the crimes, which made it clear some of the other four suspects were talking. Hinckley emphasized that Gribble&rsquo;s case was not about guilt &mdash; which Gribble acknowledged &mdash; but about the insanity defense and whether Gribble should be legally liable for his actions.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Gribble is also challenging the instruction Superior Court Judge Gillian Abramson gave on insanity, saying it was weighted toward the state&rsquo;s case.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Gribble&rsquo;s lawyers asked the judge during the trial to give an instruction that did include factors for jurors to consider, including his immaturity and lack of social skills. Abramson denied that request and gave instructions that included examples &mdash; in one instance, telling jurors, &lsquo;&lsquo;You may also consider whether the defendant acted impulsively or acted with cunning and planning in executing his crimes and escaping without detection.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Hinckley argued that Gribble&rsquo;s trial lawyers were trying to &lsquo;&lsquo;tailor&rsquo;&rsquo; the instructions to fit Gribble&rsquo;s psyche. He said the instructions given were &lsquo;&lsquo;very objective&rsquo;&rsquo; and characterized the defense&rsquo;s case for insanity &lsquo;&lsquo;extremely weak.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; Two oil companies are paying the state of New Hampshire a total of $35 million to settle pending claims from a lawsuit alleging that they added MTBE to gasoline, knowing that it would contaminate ground water supplies, Attorney General Michael Delaney said Thursday.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The state, which sued the companies and others in 2003, contends they knew they were supplying a product with unique hazards &mdash; specifically, that MTBE travels father and is more difficult to clean up than other contaminants.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Shell Oil Company and Sunoco Inc. agreed to the settlement, Delaney said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Shell is pleased to reach a resolution with the state of New Hampshire in this matter,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Kayla Macke, a spokeswoman for Shell. A call to an attorney representing Sunoco wasn&rsquo;t immediately returned Thursday afternoon.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>A trial against remaining defendants is scheduled to start in Concord on Jan. 7, 2013. They are Exxon/Mobil Corporation, Irving Oil Co., Citgo Petroleum, ConocoPhillips Co., and Vitol S.A.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The state is seeking damages to perform comprehensive investigation and remediation of MTBE contamination sites.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;We must ensure that our public waters remain clean and safe for the benefit of all our citizens,&rsquo;&rsquo; Delaney said. He called the settlement &lsquo;&lsquo;a  substantial recovery that will be used to clean up contaminated groundwaters throughout New Hampshire.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>At the time the lawsuit was filed, some of the oil companies said when used as intended, MTBE is safe and effective, and the problem was with leaking gasoline storage tanks.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, is a petroleum-based additive that has been used in gasoline since the 1970s to increase octane and reduce smog-causing emissions. Since 1990, it had been used widely in states with air quality problems to satisfy a federal requirement that gasoline contains 2 percent oxygen.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>While it was credited for cutting air pollution, MTBE was found in the late 1990s to contaminate drinking water supplies when gasoline is spilled or leaks into surface or groundwater.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>A number of states found MTBE in groundwater near leaking gasoline storage tanks and water agencies reported MTBE found in drinking water supplies, although in most cases concentrations did not exceed EPA advisory levels.</p>

    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; A number of New Hampshire schools opened a little later and some commuters had accidents Thursday as a nor'easter brought the first snowfall of the season for some and a wintry mix of precipitation for others.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Visibility was challenging for some commuters early Thursday, with the snow coming down fast. State authorities limited speeds to 45 mph on roads.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The New Hampshire Department of Transportation said it did not pre-treat the roads because the storm was forecast to include rain, which would have washed it away.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Snow accumulation was light in general, with most area reporting an inch to 2 inches. WMUR-TV reported that Somersworth received 3.5 inches of snow by 7 a.m. Snow falling along the coast had changed over to sleet and rain.</p>

                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>University of New Hampshire students headed out at midnight to enjoy the campus&rsquo; first snow of the year. Some students made snow angels, had snowball fights.</p>

    <p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Here we are, it\xE2\x80\x99s Thursday, and we\xE2\x80\x99re just days away from the big Veterans Day weekend. Got any plans? Even if it\xE2\x80\x99s not a major holiday for you, you really should check out the display in the lobby of 51 Walden. It will not only get you in the spirit, but you\xE2\x80\x99ll learn a whole lot. Jill Henderson and Carole Wayland have pulled together an impressive collection of World War II memorabilia, to coincide with the run of <i>Mister Roberts</i>, the current <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.concordplayers.org\">Concord Players</a> show which of course takes place during that timeframe. They have lots of really cool stuff that will leave you breathless.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>There\xE2\x80\x99s a vintage Red Cross uniform; propaganda posters like the Uncle Sam one that says \xE2\x80\x9CI Want YOU for U.S. Army,\xE2\x80\x9D and the one that admonishes you not to tell where our ships are. There are letters from veterans, photos, even a telegram informing of the death of a soldier \xE2\x80\x93 an amazing glimpse into an historic time. Jill and Carole have done an extraordinary job pulling out their own collections, and rounding up pieces from other people. It\xE2\x80\x99s a lovely way to honor our veterans, so drop in and take a look next time you\xE2\x80\x99re heading through town.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b><i>First Responders</i></b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>So we all know we had a big storm here last week, one that brought a lot of trees down and interrupted electrical service for about 3,500 customers around town. But thankfully, we have our own <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.concordma.gov%2fpages%2fConcordMA_TownManager%2ftownreport07%2fLight%2520Plant\">Concord Municipal Light Plant</a>, which makes all the difference. Because within the first 36 hours, with a little help from some other local light plants, CMLP had restored power to 93 percent of their customers. That\xE2\x80\x99s an impressive statistic.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>And I\xE2\x80\x99m sure you\xE2\x80\x99ve seen their crews out and about, clearing the trees, installing new poles, and generally improving the electrical system. Kudos to them for keeping us awash in light and heat!</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b><i>Nearly normal</i></b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>I mentioned recently that I had no idea that <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.emersonumbrella.org%2ftheater%2f2012-fall-productions%2f\">Emerson Umbrella</a> was <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2farticles%2fall-the-world-s-a-stage-636a09bb\">host to theatrical productions:</a> <i>The Rocky Horror Show</i> just ended, and the next show is set to start this Friday.<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fNext_to_Normal\"> <i>Next to Normal</i></a> is a Tony and Pulitzer Award winning musical about a mother with bipolar disorder and the effect this has on her family. I will say it\xE2\x80\x99s not one of those shiny, happy musicals that makes you all warm and fuzzy; instead it deals with some pretty powerful issues, including mental illness, grieving, loss, ethics in modern psychiatry, and suburban life. Most of us can probably relate to at least one or two of those issues.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>I\xE2\x80\x99m personally excited to go see it because the mother is played by the very talented Maria Wardwell. She\xE2\x80\x99s a personal friend of mine who has appeared in numerous musicals around the area, including <i>Falsettos</i> and <i>Into the Woods</i>, and who has an amazing voice. If the rest of the cast is the same caliber, it will be a show worth seeing.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>It runs for the next three weekends, Nov. 9 through Nov. 24, with two matinees on Nov. 18 and 24. Tickets are $20 and $25.

                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; The lawyer for a New Hampshire man seeking to reverse his conviction for the murder of a woman hacked to death with a machete and knife says jurors knew too much about the case and were emotionally influenced by the crimes. A prosecutor countered that there wasn&rsquo;t a county in the state where potential jurors hadn&rsquo;t heard of the gruesome attacks.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Public defender Stephanie Hausman argued Thursday that the state Supreme Court should order a new trial for 23-year-old Christopher Gribble of Brookline. She said the trial should have been moved out of Hillsborough County, where the 2009 Mont Vernon home invasion occurred.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Gribble is serving a life sentence without possibility of parole for killing 42-year-old Kimberly Cates and maiming her 11-year-old daughter, Jaimie. He and Steven Spader were convicted of first-degree murder and multiple other felonies.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Gribble was one of five men who broke into the Cates&rsquo; home Oct. 4, 2009.  They crept to the master bedroom, where the mother and daughter lay asleep. Gribble testified that he and Spader stood on either side of the bed in the master bedroom where the mother and daughter lay asleep. They began stabbing and slashing the two repeatedly &mdash; Spader wielding the machete and Gribble a knife. Gribble stabbed Jaimie repeatedly with the knife, then used it to slit her mother&rsquo;s throat to be sure she was dead.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Hausman argued the trial should have been moved to a different county because of the publicity about Spader&rsquo;s trial, which preceded Gribble&rsquo;s trial by a few months.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Here we have the kind of crimes that evoke visceral reactions,&rsquo;&rsquo; Hausman said. She noted that 60 percent of the jurors who decided Gribble&rsquo;s fate had been involved in discussions about the crimes before being called for jury duty.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Assistant Attorney General Peter Hinckley argued that no matter where Gribble&rsquo;s trial was held, there would be jurors who knew about the case.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;This wasn&rsquo;t just known statewide, this was a national case,&rsquo;&rsquo; Hinckley said, listing the national news organizations that covered both Gribble&rsquo;s and Spader&rsquo;s trials.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Gribble was convicted in March 2011, after a jury rejected his defense of insanity.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Hausman also challenged the admission of Gribble&rsquo;s detailed confession to a state police detective, which he gave after saying he didn&rsquo;t want to talk anymore. She told the justices the detective who recorded the confession did not &lsquo;&lsquo;scrupulous honor&rsquo;&rsquo; Gribble&rsquo;s decision to end the interrogation.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Hinckley countered that it was Gribble who instructed the detective to go and get his tape recorder, stating, &lsquo;&lsquo;I'll tell you everything.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;He went to get a tape recorder,&rsquo;&rsquo; Hinckley said of the detective. &lsquo;&lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t have a recorder because he had no expectation he (Gribble) was going to speak.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Hinckley said Gribble was motivated by information the detective told him they knew about the crimes, which made it clear some of the other four suspects were talking. Hinckley emphasized that Gribble&rsquo;s case was not about guilt &mdash; which Gribble acknowledged &mdash; but about the insanity defense and whether Gribble should be legally liable for his actions.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Gribble is also challenging the instruction Superior Court Judge Gillian Abramson gave on insanity, saying it was weighted toward the state&rsquo;s case.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Gribble&rsquo;s lawyers asked the judge during the trial to give an instruction that did include factors for jurors to consider, including his immaturity and lack of social skills. Abramson denied that request and gave instructions that included examples &mdash; in one instance, telling jurors, &lsquo;&lsquo;You may also consider whether the defendant acted impulsively or acted with cunning and planning in executing his crimes and escaping without detection.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Hinckley argued that Gribble&rsquo;s trial lawyers were trying to &lsquo;&lsquo;tailor&rsquo;&rsquo; the instructions to fit Gribble&rsquo;s psyche. He said the instructions given were &lsquo;&lsquo;very objective&rsquo;&rsquo; and characterized the defense&rsquo;s case for insanity &lsquo;&lsquo;extremely weak.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="">
    <p>The justices did not indicate when they will issue a ruling.<img alt="end of story marker" border="0" height="8" width="6" src="http://www.boston.com/r/SysConfig/WebPortal/Boston/Framework/images/site_graphics/dingbat_story_end_icon.gif" class="storyend"></p>

    <p>Wesleyan succeeds with local players
    </p>
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Former rivals in the Dual County League, Acton-Boxborough Regional grad <strong>Kevin Hughes </strong>and Concord-Carlisle High products <strong>Dan &shy;D&rsquo;Arcy
    </strong>&nbsp;and <strong>&shy;Peter George
    </strong> are contributing to the best football season at Wesleyan University since 2002.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Wesleyan, 5-2 in the New England Small College Athletic Conference, hosts undefeated (7-0) league rival Trinity College on Saturday.  A victory in the season finale would enable the Cardinals to match the six-win season of the 1998 squad.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;This season has been a turning point for our program,&rdquo; said Hughes, a 6-foot-4, 240-pound junior who is also joined on the roster by senior tackle <strong>Jim Curley</strong>,&nbsp;a graduate of St. Sebastian&rsquo;s School in Needham, and sophomore backup defensive lineman <strong>Zach Bartlett
    </strong>&nbsp;of Norfolk. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re learning how to win, and hopefully we&rsquo;re moving in the right direction.&rdquo; </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Lining up as an H-back and tight end, Hughes has hauled in 28 receptions for 408 yards and three touchdowns, while the 6-3, 215-pound D&rsquo;Arcy, a senior wide receiver, has 10 catches for 64 yards and a touchdown. Both are also effective downfield blockers. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>George, a 6-foot-2, 210-pound sophomore backup QB, has chipped in with four tackles on special teams.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Two weeks ago, Hughes caught a 22-yard scoring pass on a fake field goal attempt as Wesleyan rallied from a 14-0 deficit to defeat Bowdoin.  &ldquo;Kevin is probably the smartest football player I&rsquo;ve coached in almost 30 years,&rdquo; said <strong>Mike Whalen</strong>, in his third season at  Wesleyan. &ldquo;His versatility has made him a special player and he has incredible hands. He&rsquo;s one of the top skill players in the NESCAC.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Shifting to D&rsquo;Arcy, he added, &ldquo;Dan came here as a quarterback, but we felt he could really be a factor at receiver. It&rsquo;s been a transition for him and he&rsquo;s improved every year.&rdquo; </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Whalen said he had an eye on Hughes when he was head coach at Williams. &ldquo;He has one more year of eligibility and if he comes back, no question he&rsquo;ll be a top receiver in this league.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Selected for the  Shriners&rsquo; Classic as a senior at Acton-Boxborough, Hughes scored two touchdowns in his first college varsity game against Bowdoin as a freshman. &ldquo;That gave me a lot of confidence going into last season,&rdquo; said the Boxborough resident, who has added 30 pounds since high school. &ldquo;But this year has been even more special. Our field was packed for homecoming against Amherst,&rdquo; with a crowd of more than 7,000 fans,  he said. &ldquo;I've never seen that many alumni at a home game.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Two of his  teammates at Acton-Boxborough now play for NESCAC opponents,  <strong>Ethan Dukes</strong>
    &nbsp;at Hamilton College and <strong>Pat Gilligan
    </strong>&nbsp;at Bates College.  </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;I had a chance to chat with Ethan at the postgame tailgate. He threw a touchdown pass to me in high school,&rdquo; Hughes said. &ldquo;I also saw Pat briefly and we had a chance to shake hands. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d all agree that we had great coaching in high school from <strong>Bill Maver
    </strong>&nbsp;and his staff who helped make it possible for us to get to the next level.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>D&rsquo;Arcy, who was succeeded as Concord-Carlisle&rsquo;s quarterback by George, was a two-time league all-star in high school and also earned a berth in the Shriners game. &ldquo;I hurt my shoulder in my last high school game,&rdquo; recalled D&rsquo;Arcy, who while at Concord-Carlisle would throw passes to <strong>Zach Driscoll</strong>,&nbsp;who is having a record-breaking senior season at NESCAC rival Middlebury.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been challenging to make the move&rsquo;&rsquo; to receiver, D&rsquo;Arcy said, &ldquo;especially after missing most of my sophomore year with a hamstring injury, so I take a lot of pride in what I&rsquo;ve been able to accomplish,  especially my blocking.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Zach  Driscoll &ldquo;is a good friend and we work out together in the offseason,&rsquo;&rsquo; D&rsquo;Arcy said. &ldquo;Peter George was two years behind me at Concord-Carlisle, and had stayed with me when he made his recruiting visit to Wesleyan.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Other Concord-Carlisle alums playing for NESCAC football teams are <strong>Ryan Ruiz
    </strong>&nbsp;(Colby) and <strong>Jibrail Coy
    </strong>&nbsp;(Bowdoin).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Whalen said George, who also plays varsity lacrosse for Wesleyan, is continuing to develop as a dropback quarterback and has been a productive special teams player,  and Curley has flourished since moving from the defensive line. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;Jim is our only senior on the offensive line and a leader who should get all-conference recognition,&rdquo; said Whalen, who added that Bartlett, a graduate of Xaverian Brothers High, is coming back from knee surgery and should compete for more playing time next season.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="">
    <p>George was a Dual County all-star in football and lacrosse; the 6-foot-3, 245-pound Curley, who is the PA announcer at Wesleyan&rsquo;s ice hockey games, was a two-time Independent School League all-star pick in football; and the 6-foot, 230-pound Bartlett was Xaverian&rsquo;s Unsung Hero and an All-Catholic Conference selection.

    </p><p><strong>Taking toys</strong> \xE2\x80\x94 Something was a little different about a theft last week on Lawrence Court in Kent.</p><p>The list of items stolen from residents over a two-day span at <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fkent.patch.com%2flistings%2fsilver-meadows-apts\">Silver Meadows Apartments</a> included laptops, HD TVs and other electronics that typically fill police reports. A box full of sex toys was also on that list.</p><p>The Pure Romance toys accounted for <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fkent.patch.com%2farticles%2fsex-toys-worth-800-lizards-reported-stolen-police-blotter\">$800 of the $3,000 worth of goods</a> taken from the one of the apartments. Three lizards, each worth $60, were also stolen.<br>\xC2\xA0 <br><strong>All about the cake</strong> \xE2\x80\x94 Though two co-workers had a history of differences, a piece of birthday cake finally brought them to blows in late October.</p><p>Katherine Perez, 26, of Cleveland, admitted to police that she <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ftwinsburg.patch.com%2farticles%2fwoman-charged-with-assault-over-a-piece-of-birthday-cake\">attacked a co-worker</a> at a Twinsburg business because she wanted the piece of cake. According to the police report, Perez didn't strike until the morning after the verbal argument. The victim said Perez entered the break room, suddenly attacked her and then exited. Two witnesses also corroborated that account.</p><p>Perez said the victim made vulgar remarks to her before and during the cake fight and also threatened her. Perez was arrested and charged with assault. She was released on a $500 bond.</p><p><strong>Long night at the bar</strong> \xE2\x80\x94 A 35-year-old Copley man was belligerent enough to make others want to leave a Bath Township pub on Nov. 3, according to a police report. </p><p>A <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ffairlawn-bath.patch.com%2flistings%2fbrubakers-pub-3\">Brubaker's</a><a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ffairlawn-bath.patch.com%2flistings%2fbrubakers-pub-3\"> Pub</a> bartender gave the drunk man a warning as people began to get more uncomfortable.

He has received a ban from Brubaker's.</p><p><strong>Is he a target?</strong> \xE2\x80\x94 Time will tell if a Strongsville remains a target now that Election Day is history.</p><p>The Pearl Road man told police that <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fstrongsville.patch.com%2farticles%2fpolitics-gets-personal-after-53-signs-stolen-from-yard\">53 political signs</a> have been taken from his yard in the weeks leading up to the election.

    							<p>SALEM --&nbsp;Nine-year-old Olivia Thompson died at an Akron hospital Saturday morning after being struck in her hometown of Salem by a hit-and-run driver.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>According to witnesses, the driver who hit her simply sped off.&nbsp; Emily Ellsworth was having dinner with friends around 9:30 p.m. Friday night.&nbsp; She was drawn outside by the commotion.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Once she got outside, she realized a child had been hit by a car.&nbsp; "A couple minutes after we got here, her parents pulled up and I realized we recognized them," said Ellsworth.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Ellsworth knows the family through her pet shop and even cared for the family's pets after their home caught fire about a year ago.</p>
    <p>"It was hard to see such a nice little girl and such a bad thing happen," said Ellsworth, who went on to describe Olivia as a "happy, active girl" who loved animals. </p>
    <p>Brandon Mohr was working at a tattoo shop at the time of the accident.&nbsp;&nbsp;He recalls hearing the crash then&nbsp;he, too, came outside.</p>
    <p>"We saw a shoe laying in the street," moments before "we heard a loud engine sounded like... he was gunning it real quick to get away," said Mohr. </p>
    <p>The driver turned himself into Salem Police Saturday morning.&nbsp; Police have not released his identity.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The driver has yet to be charged, but police say charges are probable and pending on the results of the investigation. </p>

    </p><p>The dog is believed to be traveling the power lines, as well as conservation areas and golf courses, and some residential neighborhoods.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    \t\t\t\t<p>Veterans Day is a time for remembering. In our\xC2\xA0families there are so many men and women who served the country -\xC2\xA0in wartime, in the eras of war and in peacetime. In\xC2\xA0our own\xC2\xA0extended family the service ranges from the Civil War, the Spanish American War, WWI, WWII, Korea, Viet Nam, Viet Nam-era, the Gulf\xC2\xA0War and up to the\xC2\xA0 conflicts of the &#8220;here and now.&#8221; It was in the Army, the Army Medical Corps and Dental Corps, the Navy, the Navy Medical Service,\xC2\xA0Navy attached to the Marines as Corpsman, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, the Air Force Medical Service,\xC2\xA0the Coast Guard and support services. From foot soldier, artillery man, medical officer, Commodore, Pharmacist&#8217;s Mate,\xC2\xA0 corpsman, Army medic,\xC2\xA0nurse\xC2\xA0and \xC2\xA0quartermaster to cook, interpreter, communications guru, swabby,\xC2\xA0dental officer\xC2\xA0and\xC2\xA0bomber pilot &#8211; their jobs\xC2\xA0were done in theaters from Europe to the Pacific to the Middle East. Most said little about the experience and the service.\xC2\xA0A few stayed in the service but\xC2\xA0most went on into civilian lives and honorable work and professions.</p>\n\
    <p>I&#8217;ve written in the past about one of these family heroes. <span><span>Navy veteran and WWII hero James W. Sweeney of Lowell\xC2\xA0died in 2008 &#8211; one of that fading\xC2\xA0 group of veterans who served flag and country\xC2\xA0then returned home to another world, another life and other duties. He never viewed himself as heroic yet his actions within a span of just ten days earned him two of the highest\xC2\xA0decorations awarded by the military for heroism &#8211; the Navy Cross and the Silver Star. He and his \xE2\x80\x9Cbrothers\xE2\x80\x9D deserve our remembrance on this 2012 Veterans Day. I posted\xC2\xA0this memory of James Sweeney in 2008 just a few weeks after his death\xC2\xA0- about his life and\xC2\xA0his actions in July, 1945. <em>Allow me to again remember James W. Sweeney:</em></span></span></p>\n\n\
    <p><span><span>Posted by </span></span><a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2frichardhowe.com%2fauthor%2fmarie%2f\"><span><span><span><span>Marie</span></span></span></span></a><span><span> on 13 Nov 2008 </span></span></p>\n\
    <p><span><span><em>I can\xE2\x80\x99t let this Veterans Day week go by without\xC2\xA0writing about\xC2\xA0Navy veteran and WWII war hero James W. Sweeney who died last week. Jim was a quiet guy and typical of\xC2\xA0his generation he said very little about his war experiences &#8211; only giving bits and pieces of the tale when asked by his young cousins.</em></span></span></p>\n\
    <blockquote><p><span><span><em>Jim was one of the &#8220;St. James Street&#8221; Sweeneys so well-known in the Sacred Heart neighborhood.\xC2\xA0After his first year at Lowell Textile Institute he left his chemistry studies to join\xC2\xA0the Navy as an aviation cadet. A year later he was commissioned a flight officer and served in Air Group 94 flying off the carrier USS Lexington. He piloted a Curtiss \xE2\x80\x9CHelldiver\xE2\x80\x9D &#8211; a two-man dive bomber. This was a tough plane to fly &#8211; overweight and overloaded it was typically unstable. Jim\xC2\xA0not surprisingly accepted its shortcomings &#8211; \xE2\x80\x9CI liked it, you flew what you had to fly.\xE2\x80\x9D One of his most harrowing experiences involved returning to land on the carrier\xE2\x80\x99s deck having cut throttle only to be waved off because the deck crew hadn\xE2\x80\x99t cleared the previous plane (his skipper\xE2\x80\x99s) from the arresting wire. Averting a certain deck disaster Jim went full throttle knowing his plane would corkscrew into the sea. The plane plunged into the water up-side-down with only the tail visible. The engine lost from the violent impact Jim was left to free his injured gunner from the rear cockpit and await a destroyer rescue. His eyes injured from the crash &#8211; the flight surgeon grounded him for a month. He later returned to action and bombed two Japanese battleships for which he was highly decorated.</em></span></span></p>\n\
    <p><span><span><em>A front page story on the November 24, 1945 Lowell SUN tells the tale under the headline \xE2\x80\x9CLowell Flier Sank Two Jap Battleships.\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\xA6\xE2\x80\x9DA 21-year old Navy pilot \xE2\x80\xA6today emerged as one of the city\xE2\x80\x99s most highly decorated heroes, and had to his credit the practical sinking of two Japanese battleships\xE2\x80\xA6 He is Lieut. (JG) James W. Sweeney, USNR, holder of the <strong>Air Medal, Silver Star and the Navy Cross</strong>, the last being the second highest decoration awarded for heroism\xE2\x80\xA6 The specific feat which won him the award &#8211; the Navy Cross &#8211; occurred last July during a carrier-based bombing attack on elements of the Japanese fleet in the Yokosuka navy yard on Honshu Island, Japan.\xE2\x80\x9D\xC2\xA0 Ten days later a similar feat &#8211; \xE2\x80\x9Cgallantry and intrepidity in action\xE2\x80\x9D &#8211; against major units of the Japanese fleet among the islands of the inland sea\xC2\xA0earned him\xC2\xA0the Silver Star. (my bold)</em></span></span></p>\n\
    <p><span><span><em>After the war Jim returned to LTI for his BS degree and a Masters from the Virginia Tech Institute. He served most of his professional career as the Chief Chemist and Plant Manager for Pellon Corporation in Lowell. His brothers also served &#8211; Charles as a Navy pilot-in-training\xC2\xA0at the end of WWII, Dr. Felix as a Navy surgeon on the NSS Haven off the coast of Korea, Dr. Tom as a Flight Surgeon, USAF and the youngest Frank in the USAF-ROTC at LTI before transferring to MCP. Their father Jim was a combat infantryman in the 79th Infantry Division in WWI.</em></span></span></p>\n\
    <p><span><span><em>Jim died last week\xC2\xA0(November 5, 2008) quietly with strength, courage\xC2\xA0and spirituality &#8211; the way he lived his life. He will be missed. RIP.</em></span></span></p></blockquote>\n\

    <p>The <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3drS0jvVJxjuU\">list of shooter attacks</a> on high schools and colleges and universities is way too long.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>One result: a new approach to training schoolkids how to act in such circumstances. As NPR headlined its story last month about the technique: \"<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.wbur.org%2fnpr%2f162712905%2fto-survive-a-shooting-students-learn-to-fight-back\">to survive a shooting, students learn how to fight back.</a>\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The essence of the new drill for students is:\xC2\xA0alert, lockdown, inform, counter, evacuate. Or, ALICE.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>What's new there? The verb \"counter.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Proponents of the new approach say there have been too many attacks for students not to be trained in how to more actively defend themselves.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Others, especially some parents, ask: does that make sense to expect kids and teens to be able to make such hair-raising, possible life-risking decisions?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>There is controversy, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2fnews%2flocal%2fmassachusetts%2f2012%2f11%2f09%2fcanton-schools-consider-training-confront-columbine-style-attackers%2fuSXw8foMOlpng8Fi4FqIuJ%2fstory.html\">now that that the training is coming to Massachusetts. The Boston Globe reports</a> that, on Nov. 14, the Massachusetts Juvenile Police Officers' Association\xC2\xA0will host ALICE training with mostly police and school officials from places including Canton, Concord, Dedham, Framingham, Franklin, New Bedford, Wellesley, West\xC2\xADborough, Winchester, and also from New Hampshire and \xC2\xADConnecticut.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>This is an important new approach to find out about and think through: should schoolkids learn to more actively defend themselves in armed attacks?

    <p>Somerville Police announced that new 911 protocols have been put in place to help those who call 911 get immediate medical support.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The following is the announcement from the Somerville Police Department, sent Nov. 5:</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><blockquote>&#13;\n\
    <p><b>Emergency Medical Dispatch Begins in Somerville.</b></p>&#13;\n\
    <p><b>\xC2\xA0</b>SOMERVILLE\xE2\x80\x94Chief Thomas Pasquarello announced that starting today, persons calling 911 to report a sick or injured person, will receive additional telephone support while medical help is on the way.\xC2\xA0 The program, called Emergency Medical Dispatch, is a State 911 mandated program that requires all 911 centers to provide medical and pre-arrival instructions to callers who are with sick or injured persons while help is being dispatched.\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0 The service is being provided by Cataldo Ambulance Service, the emergency medical service provider for Somerville.</p>&#13;\n\
    <p>When callers dial 911 to report a sick or injured person, and if the caller is with the patient, the 911 call taker will first determine the address where the emergency is located.\xC2\xA0 The caller will then be transferred to a specially trained Emergency Medical Dispatcher at Cataldo Ambulance for medical support or instructions while police and fire units are on the way.\xC2\xA0 The goal of this program is to improve the level of treatment of patients before the first responders arrive.</p>&#13;\n\
    <p>Somerville Police officials emphasized that callers dialing 911 from a mobile phone will, under current protocols, continue to be routed to a State Police call center in Framingham that will then transfer the call to Somerville 911.\xC2\xA0 It is therefore faster to call 911 from a non-wireless phone if one is available.\xC2\xA0 Most land based phones will connect directly to Somerville 911.</p>&#13;\n\
    <p>Somerville Police and Fire Departments will continue to respond to emergency medical calls with Cataldo Ambulance Service as always.\xC2\xA0 This new program is designed to inform the caller of what steps can be taken until help arrives. \xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0</p>&#13;\n\

    <p>Two bites into the apple cider doughnut muffin at 3 Little Figs &mdash; a love child of a pastry, if there ever was one &mdash; it became apparent that serious thanks were due to Yia Yia,&nbsp;the late grandmother of owner Katie Rooney&nbsp;and the real inspiration behind this friendly bakery caf&eacute; in Somerville. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>After all, if Yia Yia hadn&rsquo;t shared her love of baking and Greek recipes with Rooney, if Yia Yia&rsquo;s passing hadn&rsquo;t inspired Rooney to quit an advertising gig and launch her own food business, the apple cider doughnut muffin and all the other terrific offerings at 3 Little Figs would be nothing but, well, a fairytale. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Rooney&rsquo;s story reads like a how-to manual for food entrepreneurs: She started out by selling baked goods at farmers markets in the Boston area, transitioned to wholesale and delivery for places like Jamaica Plain&rsquo;s City Feed and Supply,&nbsp;and ultimately opened 3 Little Figs as her own bricks-and-mortar operation in October 2011. &nbsp;
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Rooney keeps family close at the Highland Avenue caf&eacute;: Mom and sister help in the kitchen; husband Andy &nbsp;oversees all things caffeinated.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The menu is a happy array of breakfast offerings, outstanding baked goods, creative sandwiches, and a few Greek dishes. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>True to Rooney&rsquo;s Mediterranean roots, such ingredients as feta, honey, tomatoes, and olives occupy prime place. But Rooney sources mainly from Massachusetts, featuring produce from Stillman&rsquo;s Farm and Jones Farm,&nbsp;apples from Carlson Orchards,&nbsp;and milk from the Jersey cows at High Lawn Farm in Lee.&nbsp;Menu items change seasonally.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>3 Little Figs gets its java fix from Gimme! Coffee of Ithaca, N.Y., as well as a rotating selection of fair trade or organic farms, mostly based in Africa and South America. Cheerful baristas lovingly craft cappuccinos ($3.50),&nbsp;lattes ($4),&nbsp;and espressos ($2.50)&nbsp;on a whiz-bang La Marzocco Strada,&nbsp; which Rooney says is one of just a few in Greater Boston.&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Breakfast fans will find a good array of choices at 3 Little Figs, ranging from the healthy to the almost sinful.  Exhibit A: the cavity-inducing, diet-ruining, oh-so-delicious apple cider doughnut muffin, stuffed with apples, spiced with nutmeg, and topped with cinnamon sugar ($2.50).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The homemade Fig N Spice granola should please even the most discerning granola guru. It&rsquo;s available with milk ($3.50)&nbsp;or Greek yogurt and honey ($4.50).&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The egg and feta ($5.50) sandwich&nbsp;is a grown-up twist on the old breakfast sandwich, with airy brioche from Iggy&rsquo;s Bakery,&nbsp;cage-free eggs, arugula, tomatoes, and a sprinkle of feta and Greek herbs. It&rsquo;s a light sandwich, a far cry from the usual hangover cure &mdash; but you can add bacon or prosciutto ($1)&nbsp;if you&rsquo;re in need of a little grease. A bit more feta and another pinch of salt would have sharpened this otherwise terrific choice. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>And then there are the pastries. A dirty chai muffin ($3)&nbsp;is &mdash; let&rsquo;s call a spade a spade &mdash; essentially a nutmeg- and cinnamon-infused cupcake topped with espresso-chai glaze. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The earthy cornmeal avocado muffin ($3.25)&nbsp;allows you to at least pretend you got a vegetable for breakfast &mdash; it is slightly green, after all. Don&rsquo;t miss the lavender biscuit with toasted almonds ($3) or the vegan ginger bomb cookies ($5 for a bag). &nbsp;
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>For lunch, look for an array of creative sandwiches, salads, and a few Greek dishes to boot. The Village sandwich ($5 for half, $8 for a whole)&nbsp;features thick slices of perfectly roasted sweet potatoes atop a bed of arugula, sun-dried tomato, and goat cheese spread. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The traditional BLT ($7)&nbsp;is nicely dressed up with caramelized bacon, a light yogurt spread, and spicy Dijon mustard. I also enjoyed the Market ($5/$8),&nbsp;a sweet-and-salty combo of prosciutto, fig jam, goat cheese, honey, and peppery arugula. 
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Rooney&rsquo;s roots shine through in the Greek cheese pie ($6),&nbsp;which seems to sell out quickly, and the spinach pie ($6).&nbsp;The latter was a hit with loads of fresh spinach and leeks, tart sheep&rsquo;s milk feta, and a super flaky crust, although it wasn&rsquo;t served quite warm enough. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The vibe at 3 Little Figs reflects the fact that it&rsquo;s a small, family shop: cheerful, laid back, and welcoming. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The service is friendly and responsive, though we had to contend with crumb-topped tables on a couple of visits. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="">
    <p>A Greek ambience is evoked with azure paint accents, mismatched blue-and-white plates, and a few photos of the famed Greek coast. 
    </p>

  summary: "The menu at 3 Litle Figs in Somerville is a happy array of breakfast offerings, outstanding baked goods, creative sandwiches, and a few Greek dishes. The popularity of this small, family-run restaurant makes it hard to find a seat during peak times, but don\xE2\x80\x99t miss the apple cider doughnut muffin."

    </p><p>The purpose of the bowhunting program is to control the deer population  safely and ethically by allowing experienced archery hunters onto town  lands.\xC2\xA0 Archery hunters who apply to the program must be experienced,  have successfully completed the bow hunter safety course, and passed a  proficiency test and interview before being accepted into the  program.\xC2\xA0We have police officers, bow hunting safety instructors, fire  fighters, and other experienced hunting and safety personnel in the  program.\xC2\xA0 No more than 25 hunters per year are given permits and these  hunters are spread out among 15 town conservation lands.\xC2\xA0 Nine of this  year\xE2\x80\x99s hunters have been in the participating in the program since 1999.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Once accepted into the program, the hunters are assigned to one of the  town's public conservation properties and may then harvest whitetail  deer, using bow and arrow only, on their assigned area. \xC2\xA0Hunters must  follow all of the state's game laws as well as additional rules dictated  by the SCC designed to maximize the safety of non-hunters who may be  using the same properties during the hunting season. All hunting  equipment (tree stands, etc.) must be clearly labeled with the hunter's  permit number.\xC2\xA0 Anyone who finds hunting equipment that does not have a  permit number is asked to contact the SCC office. It is unlawful to  tamper with hunting equipment on SCC lands whether or not the equipment  is properly labeled.\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>-  "Re: Traffic Flow.  There are now signs at the Moore Road, Glezen Lane,   and Training Field intersections with Rt. 126 which say, "No access to   Town Center.  Use Rt. 126."  First of all, historically the Town  Center  of Wayland is something other than a shopping mall.  Second, are  they  now not allowing left-hand turns onto Rt. 27 from these roads?   Or are  they going to take a lesson from the town of Lincoln and block  them off  from 27?" - <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwayland.patch.com%2fusers%2fanna-laura-rosow">Anna Laura Rosow</a></p><p>&#13;

    </p><p>-  "I have absolutely nothing against (those over 21) drinking or   celebrating after a game.  The problem that I have is when you then get   in a car and drive yourself home.  THAT is where I have a huge issue,   and it is something that is comletely avoidable which puts not only the   driver at risk, but puts everyone else on the road with them at risk.     I also understand that one is innocent until proven guilty BY THE LAW.    But this is not a media report alone, this is an actual arrest with  OUI  charges and a moving vehicle violation, and an employer has every  right  to respond to an arrest without waiting for a verdict from the  courts.   In this case the OUI arrest of a teacher (health and  wellness?!   Really?!), coach and role model should be enough  justification for there  to be severe and immediate consequences enacted  by the school district.   An incredibly negative example has now been  set for the town's youth  and, while Dr. Stein states that Wayland  doesn't have an automatic  response for situations like this, that does  NOT prevent them, as Mr.  Cincotta's employer, from establishing their  own employment-based  consequences based on the arrest alone and outside  of what the law may  or may not find Mr. Cincotta guilty of." - <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwayland.patch.com%2fusers%2famy-simmons-2">Amy Simmons</a></p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>-  "I agree with you almost entirely Amy; the employer has a right to   respond separate from the legal system and the accusation is a serious   one with great risk for others. On the other hand, I would contend that   you do not understand the notion of innocent until proven guilty, and   you proved that in your next sentence.  An "actual" arrest does not   prove that a person committed the crime they are accused of.  Based upon   your explanation, an arrest is the equivalent of a finding of guilt in   court.  That IS something that is perpetrated by the media.  You  rarely,  if ever, hear reported when an arrest that was made ultimately  proves  to be inaccurate.  I am not saying that is the case here, but  all people  are due that legal process." - <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwayland.patch.com%2fusers%2fdhs-d6b0d394">DHS</a></p><p>&#13;

    </p><p>- "As a runner and cyclist that frequents the area and lives in Wayland, I  guarantee this will be dangerous to non-vehicular traffic. We can't even  get cars to stop at marked cross walks for pedestrians. Drivers are  distracted and impatient. They speed through all areas of town, and  frequently through school zones. I do think there will be a fatality  sooner rather than later." - <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwayland.patch.com%2fusers%2fmichele-c-77329b4c">Michele C</a></p><p>&#13;

Police did some checking and verified that John R. Abbott, of Wayland, was in fact at a Concord hospital.

  title: Obama's winning margins in NH college towns drop

    </div>
    
    
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; President Barack Obama doesn&rsquo;t appear to have much to show for his campaign&rsquo;s aggressive effort to encourage college students &mdash; particularly out-of-staters &mdash; to vote in New Hampshire.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>While the president won all four of New Hampshire&rsquo;s major college communities &mdash; Durham, Hanover, Keene and Plymouth &mdash; by wide margins Tuesday, his advantage in those towns actually shrank compared to 2008.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>For example, Obama won 82 percent of the vote in Hanover, home to Dartmouth College, in 2008, but only 75 percent on Tuesday. In Durham, Obama&rsquo;s margin of victory dropped from 74 percent four years ago to 69 percent Tuesday.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Those kinds of drops weren&rsquo;t unusual &mdash; overall, Obama&rsquo;s share of the vote decreased in nearly three-quarters of all towns and cities compared to 2008. But the results in the college towns stand out given the extent to which the Obama campaign courted students.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The campaign actively urged out-of-state students to register in New Hampshire, telling them that their vote &lsquo;&lsquo;counts more&rsquo;&rsquo; in a swing state. Former President Bill Clinton campaigned for Obama at the University of New Hampshire, telling students that Republicans were trying to take away their right to vote.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;They've worked so hard to keep you from voting,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said at a rally in October.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Clinton was referring to a new voter registration law backed by Republican legislative leaders who argued that liberal-minded out-of-state students were diluting the votes of New Hampshire residents.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The law, which was ultimately put on hold before the election after students challenged it in court, would have required new voters to sign a statement saying they are subject to laws that apply to all residents, including laws requiring drivers to register cars and get New Hampshire driver&rsquo;s licenses.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Students traditionally have been allowed to declare the state their home for voting purposes without holding legal residency, which involves an intent to stay for an extended period of time. The statement wouldn&rsquo;t have specifically required students to be residents but would have made them subject to hundreds of laws involving residency.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>It&rsquo;s unclear how the controversy over the law played out on Election Day. In Durham, home to the University of New Hampshire, town officials said a record-breaking 3,024 people registered to vote on Tuesday, casting more than 40 percent of the town&rsquo;s total vote. Officials said the overwhelming majority of them were students, though how many were out-of-staters is unknown, and there&rsquo;s no way of knowing how any of them voted.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>As the registration line grew, election workers scrambled to move people around the local high school so as few voters as possible would have to wait outside in the cold. Worried that some might get discouraged and leave, volunteers went up and down the line distributing candy &mdash; 30 bags full &mdash; to lighten the mood. Inside, 40 workers manned 17 tables to get people registered.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;It looked a little bit like the New York Stock Exchange in terms of the level of activity and all the hand signals,&rsquo;&rsquo; said town administrator Todd Selig.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The town also registered students on campus ahead of the election, but only 400 signed up this year, compared to about 1,000 who signed up early in 2008 and 1,700 who waited until Election Day. Selig believes the media coverage of the new voter registration law led to Tuesday&rsquo;s rush by reinforcing the notion that students have a right to vote where they attend school.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;My strong opinion is that the young people who come to vote are not in any way, shape or form trying to game the system by voting in their college community,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;&lsquo;They simply want to participate in the democratic process.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Though it&rsquo;s impossible to determine what kind of effect out-of-state college students have on elections, the impact is likely greater in New Hampshire, where out-of-staters make up a greater percentage of enrollment than in all but three other states. An analysis of total enrollment in the fall of 2011 showed just over 32,500 out-of-staters &mdash; a significant number in a small state &mdash; but no one knows how many of them actually voted in New Hampshire.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="">
    <p>More broadly, exit polls Tuesday showed Obama hung onto to his support among young voters &mdash; not necessarily college students &mdash; compared to 2008. In New Hampshire, 12 percent of voters Tuesday were between the ages of 18 and 24, and they backed Obama 67 to 30 percent. That was similar to the 2008 exit poll results.<img alt="end of story marker" border="0" height="8" width="6" src="http://www.boston.com/r/SysConfig/WebPortal/Boston/Framework/images/site_graphics/dingbat_story_end_icon.gif" class="storyend"></p>
