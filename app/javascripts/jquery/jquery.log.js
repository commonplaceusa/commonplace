 * jQuery.log v1.0.0 - A jQuery plugin that unifies native console logging across browsers
 * 
 * @usage		call jQuery.log([args...]) to write to attempt to write to the console of any browser. 
 *				**See http: *azoffdesign.com/plugins/js/log for an example.
 * @param 		args...	one or more javascript objects to be written to the console
 * @returns 	true if a console was detected and successfully used, false if the plug-in had to resort to alert boxes
 * @note 		if a plug-in cannot be located then an alert is called with the arguments you wish to log. Multiple 
 *              arguments are separated with a space.
 * @depends 	just make sure you have jQuery and some code you want to debug.
