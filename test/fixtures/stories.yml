    <p>The bad news is, a mosquito tested positive for West Nile Virus last month in Cuyahoga Falls; the good news is, no other cases have been found.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>According to Andrew Deikun, a mosquito control coordinator with the Summit County Public Health Department, the mosquito carrying West Nile was caught in a trap set on Bonnett Drive on July 17.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>As a precautionary measure, the health department sprayed within a one-mile radius of Bonnett on Aug. 6 to target and kill adult mosquitos.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Since then, two traps have been placed on Bonnett \xE2\x80\x93 one on Aug. 7, the other on Aug. 22 \xE2\x80\x93 to determine whether mosquitos may still be carrying West Nile in the neighborhood.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Mosquitos caught in the trap set on Aug. 7 were tested by the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpublichealth.columbus.gov%2f\">Columbus Public Health Department</a> and the results came back negative. Deikun will know early next month whether any cases were found in the second trap since it takes about two weeks to get test results back.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>On Sept. 9, 13 residents from Lexington will walk up to 26.2 miles along the historic route of the Boston Marathon in the 24th annual <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.jimmyfund.org%2feve%2fevent%2fboston-marathon-jimmy-fund-walk%2f\">Boston Marathon Jimmy Fund Walk</a> presented by Hyundai. They will be among the 9,000 walkers expected to participate with the collective goal of raising more than $7.5 million to support lifesaving adult and pediatric patient care and cancer research at <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dana-farber.org%2f\">Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Boston Marathon Jimmy Fund Walk is the largest single-day participatory event benefiting the Jimmy Fund and Dana-Farber and has raised nearly $80 million since its inception in 1989 to conquer all forms of cancer. The <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.baa.org%2f\">Boston Athletic Association</a> has supported the Boston Marathon Jimmy Fund Walk for the past 24 years.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CEvery year, the Boston Marathon Jimmy Fund Walk unites thousands of people \xE2\x80\x94 from parents, neighbors, coworkers, cancer patients, cancer survivors, and the young and the old \xE2\x80\x94 who share a goal to bring an end to cancer,\xE2\x80\x9D says Ann Beach, director of the Boston Marathon Jimmy Fund Walk. \xE2\x80\x9CTheir dedication and commitment to fundraising for the event enables Dana-Farber to aggressively pursue its life-saving mission.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Participants may choose to walk one of four routes: the entire 26.2-mile Hopkinton to Boston route, the 13.1-mile Babson to Boston route, the 5-mile Boston College route, or the 3-mile route starting at Dana-Farber\xE2\x80\x99s campus. Those unable to participate on Boston Marathon Jimmy Fund Walk day can become \xE2\x80\x9CVirtual Walkers\xE2\x80\x9D and still fundraise for the event.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Walkers begin in Hopkinton between 5:30-7:30 a.m.; at Babson College between 8:30-9:30 a.m.; at Boston College between 10 a.m. and noon; and from Dana-Farber at 1:30 p.m. The Boston Marathon Jimmy Fund Walk finishes at Copley   Square in Boston, where walkers can celebrate completing the course and enjoy complimentary food, beverages, a speaking program, and entertainment.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>All walkers must raise a minimum of $300, and walkers 12-years-old and younger have a fundraising minimum of $100. Pacesetters are extraordinary fundraisers who raise $1,250 or more. Young Pacesetters are children 12 years old and younger who raise $500 or more.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; Politicians like to say campaigns are a marathon, not a sprint. But New Hampshire is turning into a relay-race, with presidential candidates and their spouses handing off the baton to each other over the next few days.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Jill Biden, wife of Vice President Joe Biden, kicked things off Friday, stopping by campaign offices in Concord, Berlin, Conway and Laconia. She'll be followed in quick succession by President Barack Obama on Saturday and the vice president on Monday. First lady Michelle Obama had been scheduled to speak at the University of New Hampshire on Tuesday but cancelled because the school is closing due to the approaching storm.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Meanwhile, Republican Mitt Romney&rsquo;s wife, Ann, will campaign in the state on Monday, and Romney plans to hold a rally Tuesday evening in the Manchester area.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan made two trips to New Hampshire in late September, but Romney hasn&rsquo;t been in the state since Sept. 6, the same day Obama, Biden and their wives campaigned in Portsmouth. Biden has been back twice since then; Obama returned for a rally last week.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The activity underscores the degree to which New Hampshire&rsquo;s four electoral college votes are valued in what is expected to be a close election. And while the Obama campaign has logged more high-profile visits recently, the Romney campaign insists it has momentum on its side.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>A WMUR-TV Granite State poll released Oct. 9 showed Obama with a slight lead over Romney in New Hampshire. A Suffolk University/7 News poll released a week later showed the two tied. Romney also recently began running television ads in the Boston market, which stretches into southern New Hampshire.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;The Obama campaign seems to be panicking,&rsquo;&rsquo; Romney spokesman Ryan Williams said Friday. &lsquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re seeing steady stream of visits from the candidates and their spouses in next several days.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In Concord on Friday, Jill Biden urged volunteers to sign up for a few more shifts and to make a few extra calls, saying their efforts could make the difference. Biden, who teaches English at a Virginia community college, emphasized the Obama administration&rsquo;s efforts to make college more affordable, and highlighted what she called the &lsquo;&lsquo;kind of scary&rsquo;&rsquo; things Republicans have said about women&rsquo;s health care and reproductive rights.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;So many women of my generation, we fought so hard for Roe vs. Wade, for access to contraception and for equal rights. We want to make sure our daughters and granddaughters don&rsquo;t have to re-fight those battles we fought decades ago,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;&lsquo;Everything we fought for is at stake.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Biden also spent a few minutes making calls to supporters to thank them for their efforts. Sitting next to her was volunteer John King, who twice asked the undecided voters he was calling if they wanted to talk to the vice president&rsquo;s wife. Both turned down the offer.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;They dissed her,&rsquo;&rsquo; he joked, then clarified that both voters said, &lsquo;&lsquo;No, thank you.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>King said he&rsquo;s been surprised that the undecided voters he&rsquo;s spoken to tend to be older. Most say the economy is driving their decision. Some days he&rsquo;s had success nudging them toward Obama, he said, while other days are less successful.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="">

    </p><p>Is it common sense to allow cities and towns to pass rules specific to certain dog breeds, such as pit bulls, in the name of public safety? Or do they unfairly target certain dogs?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Last week, Gov. Deval Patrick signed an animal rights bill that takes effect Nov. 1 and includes a stipulation prohibiting cities and towns from creating breed specific rules at the local level.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The move has angered some Boston officials, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.bostonherald.com%2fnews%2fpolitics%2fview.bg%3farticleid%3d1061155151%26amp%3bsrvc%3drss\">the Boston Herald reports</a>, as the new state law would negate the city's \"<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cityofboston.gov%2fanimalcontrol%2fregulations%2fpitbull.asp\">Responsible Pit Bull Ownership</a>\" ordinance that, among other rules, requires pit bull owners to keep their dogs muzzled when off the owner's private property. Boston adopted the ordinance in 2004 after several pit bull attacks in the city captured officials' attention.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Other cities have also wrangled over how to deal with a perceived issue regarding pit bulls and public safety. In Malden, the city council approved a bill this spring that would have <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fmalden.patch.com%2farticles%2fcity-will-require-muzzles-on-some-pit-bulls\">required muzzles for newly registered pit bulls</a>, but Mayor\xC2\xA0Gary Christenson later <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fmalden.patch.com%2farticles%2fpit-bull-law-goes-un-vetoed-but-with-suggested-amendments\">vetoed the bill</a> and suggested amendments to the law.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>After his veto in April, Christenson wrote to the council, \"The ordinance should be centered on how a dog behaves and not how a dog looks as I believe this legislation suggests.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Best Friends Animal Society says about <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.bestfriends.org%2fnomorehomelesspets%2fpit_bulls.cfm\">half of the dogs killed in shelters today are pit bulls or pit bull mixes</a>, and that there are 20 different species of\xC2\xA0dogs that are commonly confused with pit bulls, thus making breed-discriminatory rules hard to enforce.\xC2\xA0The Humane Society of the United States says that in media-reported animal cruelty cases, dogs and <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.humanesociety.org%2fissues%2fabuse_neglect%2ffacts%2fanimal_cruelty_facts_statistics.html\">in particular pit bulls are the most common victims of animal cruelty</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>On the other hand,\xC2\xA0DogsBite.org, a national dog bite victims' group, says that from 2006 to 2008,\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dogsbite.org%2fdogsbite-newsroom-2009-dogsbite-three-year-fatality-study.php\">pit bulls accounted for 59 percent of all fatal dog attacks</a> in the U.S. The next highest breed, rottweilers, accounted for 14 percent of those deaths.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Is the new state law prohibiting breed specific local ordinances turning a blind eye to a problem? Or do those types of rules unfairly target a specific breed and punish dogs for having bad owners? Tell us what you think in the comments below.</strong></p>\n\

  content: "<div><div>\n\
    <p><b>Back to School Calendar</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Teachers within the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flps.lexingtonma.org%2f\">Lexington Public Schools</a> head back to school next Monday, Aug. 27. For students, the school year begins the following day, Tuesday, Aug. 28, with the first full day for all students on Wednesday, Aug. 29. And then school\xE2\x80\x99s closed on Aug. 31 (offices open though) and Sept. 3 for Labor Day. Back to School nights are: Thursday, Sept. 20 for elementary schools, Sept. 27 for the middle schools and Oct. 4 for Lexington High.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>Getting to School</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>For those students signed up to take the bus to school, passes were mailed out earlier this week. According to the district website, bus routes will not be published in the local newspaper, nor will they be posted online. The website does not explain why this decision was made, and the district\xE2\x80\x99s Transportation Coordinator Elaine Celi did not immediately respond to an email from Patch requesting elaboration. Meanwhile, elementary school families can expect an email blast regarding after school bus schedules. </p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>In Administrative News</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>There\xE2\x80\x99s been a bit of moving and shaking among administrators within the Lexington Public Schools.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>One of those moves was the appointment of Anna Monaco as the new principal of Jonas Clarke Middle School. Monaco, the unanimous choice of a search committee, previously served as an assistant principal at Clarke. She takes over for outgoing Principal Steven Flynn, who\xE2\x80\x99s leaving Lexington for an administration job in Saudi Arabia. </p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Another new principal is Laura Lasa, who was appointed to the top spot at Lexington High after her predecessor, Natalie Cohen, announced her retirement plans. Lasa came up through the Lexington Public Schools and was an associate principal at LHS prior to her appointment. </p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>Meal Time</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Meal pricing is consistent across the board within the Lexington Public Schools. At the elementary, middle and high schools, a full-priced lunch costs $3.25, while reduced price lunch is 40 cents. At all schools, full-priced breakfast costs $2 and reduced breakfast is 30 cents.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Earlier this summer, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flps.lexingtonma.org%2fsite%2fdefault.aspx%3fPageType%3d3%26amp%3bModuleInstanceID%3d24%26amp%3bViewID%3d047E6BE3-6D87-4130-8424-D8E4E9ED6C2A%26amp%3bRenderLoc%3d0%26amp%3bFlexDataID%3d2742%26amp%3bPageID%3d1\">Whitsons School Nutrition announced its new partnership with LPS</a>, and that they\xE2\x80\x99ll provide a dining program in which meals meet the new Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act requirements</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>A Little Bit About Aspen</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>If you\xE2\x80\x99re new to the district, then you must get hip to Aspen, the secure student information management system LPS uses to manage student grading, scheduling, attendance and other data.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>Link Dump! </b></p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>To the Editor,</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>As  your state representative, I have had privilege of working with Susan  Fargo to represent our community at the State House, and I can tell you  there is no better candidate to take her place than <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.joekearnsgoodwin.com%2f\">Joe Kearns Goodwin</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Concord is the heart of the Third Middlesex District, and Joe\xE2\x80\x99s home. He grew up steps from the Old North  Bridge and understands, unlike no one else in the race, the rich  history and natural landscape here and why we must fight to preserve it  for generations to come.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In  1999, he took a semester off from <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fharvard.edu\">Harvard College</a> to help me run my  first campaign to become your State Representative. Two years later, Joe  could have done nearly anything with his degree or gone anywhere with  his career, but following the events of 9/11, he enlisted in the Army  out of a sense of duty to our community. He saw no reason anyone should  be in line before him to serve the community we all love so much.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>At  no point in his life has Joe ever forgotten where he came from. As our  state Senator, Joe will always keep fighting for\xC2\xA0Concord and the Third Middlesex, no matter how difficult the challenge or entrenched the  special interests. He is committed to standing up for our environment  and seniors, defending education funding, and fighting\xC2\xA0for middle class  families. Some candidates run for office in order to fulfill a personal  dream or add to a list of accomplishments; Joe is running to genuinely  improve the lives of those around him.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Joe  will never stop fighting for our values and to ensure the next  generation has the same opportunities he had. I urge you to join me in  voting for him on Thursday, Sept. 6.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>&#13;\n\

  content: "<div><div><p><b>\xC2\xA0</b>Norman L. Daggett, 91, of Concord and formerly of Lexington, died on August 22, 2012.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Born on May 19, 1921 to Harold and Ethel Daggett in Montclair, NJ, he grew up in Barnstable, MA.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>From early childhood, his engineering bent was in evidence. He became an electrical engineer, receiving a bachelor's degree from MIT in 1947.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>His college education was interrupted by World War II. He enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1942 and was sent to Officer Candidate School to train as a radar officer. In the fall of 1943, he was sent to East Anglia, England as a Communications Officer in the 8<sup>th</sup> Air Corps, serving there until the end of the war. His last station was RAF Tibenham, near Norwich, in the 8<sup>th</sup> Air Corps 2<sup>nd</sup> Division, 703<sup>rd</sup> Bombardment Squadron of the 445<sup>th</sup> Bomb Group, under then-Captain and Squadron Commander James Stewart, the American film and stage actor. He left the service in November 1945 with the rank of Captain.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>After graduating from MIT, Jay Forrester of MIT hired him as a research assistant to work at MIT's Digital Computer Laboratory on Whirlwind, an early digital computer. A short stint at Bell Aircraft in Niagara Falls, NY interrupted his seven years of work at the MIT Barta Building under Mr. Forrester. Many of that group moved out to MIT's Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, where Norm and two others were in charge of the design of the next computer, the TX0. He worked in several groups at Lincoln Lab, serving for a time as an assistant group leader. Later he worked on orbital tracking of manned spacecraft for Project Mercury and subsequently on Project Westford, which sent a band of needles to be used for global communication into space. In 1969, he joined Interactive Data Corporation in Waltham, and there developed a packet network with error correction capability that he supervised until his retirement in 1988.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Norm was a long time member of the Appalachian Mountain Club. He enjoyed skiing, hiking in the White Mountains and Maine, and working on his computer.\xC2\xA0 He particularly loved spending time in Acadia National Park with family and friends; tea and popovers on the lawn of the Jordan Pond House after a hike was always a special treat.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>He is survived by his wife Marjorie of 50 years; his son John, daughter-in-law Ruri, and granddaughters Lilia and Milena of Tokyo, Japan; daughter Sally of Portland, ME; daughter Molly and granddaughter Alise of Seattle, WA; and son Thomas of Vancouver, Canada.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A memorial service will be held on Saturday, September 15, 2012 at 11:00 am in the Duvall Chapel, Newbury Court, 80 Deaconess Road, Concord, MA.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In lieu of flowers, donations in his memory may be made to MIT for the MIT Class of 1947 Endowed Scholarship Fund, c/o MIT <em>Director of Memorial Gifts, 600 Memorial Drive, W98-500, Cambridge, MA 02139.</em></p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>Is it common sense to allow cities and towns to pass rules specific to certain dog breeds, such as pit bulls, in the name of public safety? Or do they unfairly target certain dogs?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Last week, Gov. Deval Patrick signed an animal rights bill that takes effect Nov. 1 and includes a stipulation prohibiting cities and towns from creating breed specific rules at the local level.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The move has angered some Boston officials, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.bostonherald.com%2fnews%2fpolitics%2fview.bg%3farticleid%3d1061155151%26amp%3bsrvc%3drss\">the Boston Herald reports</a>, as the new state law would negate the city's \"<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cityofboston.gov%2fanimalcontrol%2fregulations%2fpitbull.asp\">Responsible Pit Bull Ownership</a>\" ordinance that, among other rules, requires pit bull owners to keep their dogs muzzled when off the owner's private property. Boston adopted the ordinance in 2004 after several pit bull attacks in the city captured officials' attention.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Other cities have also wrangled over how to deal with a perceived issue regarding pit bulls and public safety. In Malden, the city council approved a bill this spring that would have <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fmalden.patch.com%2farticles%2fcity-will-require-muzzles-on-some-pit-bulls\">required muzzles for newly registered pit bulls</a>, but Mayor\xC2\xA0Gary Christenson later <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fmalden.patch.com%2farticles%2fpit-bull-law-goes-un-vetoed-but-with-suggested-amendments\">vetoed the bill</a> and suggested amendments to the law.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>After his veto in April, Christenson wrote to the council, \"The ordinance should be centered on how a dog behaves and not how a dog looks as I believe this legislation suggests.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Best Friends Animal Society says about <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.bestfriends.org%2fnomorehomelesspets%2fpit_bulls.cfm\">half of the dogs killed in shelters today are pit bulls or pit bull mixes</a>, and that there are 20 different species of\xC2\xA0dogs that are commonly confused with pit bulls, thus making breed-discriminatory rules hard to enforce.\xC2\xA0The Humane Society of the United States says that in media-reported animal cruelty cases, dogs and <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.humanesociety.org%2fissues%2fabuse_neglect%2ffacts%2fanimal_cruelty_facts_statistics.html\">in particular pit bulls are the most common victims of animal cruelty</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>On the other hand,\xC2\xA0DogsBite.org, a national dog bite victims' group, says that from 2006 to 2008,\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dogsbite.org%2fdogsbite-newsroom-2009-dogsbite-three-year-fatality-study.php\">pit bulls accounted for 59 percent of all fatal dog attacks</a> in the U.S. The next highest breed, rottweilers, accounted for 14 percent of those deaths.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Is the new state law prohibiting breed specific local ordinances turning a blind eye to a problem? Or do those types of rules unfairly target a specific breed and punish dogs for having bad owners? Tell us what you think in the comments below.</strong></p>\n\

    <p>BOSTON (CBS) &#8211; Boston Police are putting the neighborhood of East Boston on alert. Three women were indecently assaulted in a six hour period. Police say there were two incidents around 6 a.m. the morning of September 26, and another just before midnight September 25.</p>
    <p>The first female victim was approached from behind in the area of Lexington and Putnam Streets. Police say the suspect engaged her in a brief conversation, then assaulted her before fleeing toward Day Square.</p>
    <p>The suspect is described as a black or black Hispanic male, dark complexion, approximately 30 years of age, with medium build wearing a black hoodie that was &#8220;turned up&#8221;.</p>
    <p>The second indecent assault involved a female victim who described a similar incident, occurring several blocks away at the corner of Brooks and Paris Streets. This time the woman struggled and fought off the attacker after the assault.</p>
    <p>The third incident occurred at Princeton and Putnam streets. The victim says the suspect possibly entered a grey van or SUV after the attack.</p>
    <p>Police have stepped up their patrols in the area and are urging residents to take safety precautions.

    \t\t\t\t\t\t<p>YES!\xC2\xA0 Exercise has been shown to be beneficial throughout pregnancy. Benefits include decrease in backaches, constipation, bloating and swelling. Additionally, regular exercise has been shown to prevent or treat diabetes that develops during pregnancy, especially in those women with a <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fsummahealth.org%2fhome%2fmedicalservices%2fBariatric%2fbmi\" target=\"_blank\">BMI (body mass index)</a> greater than 33.\xC2\xA0 Exercise also boosts your mood and energy level and helps you sleep better. Additionally, it creates good workout habits that can be continued after delivery.</p>\n\

These women include those with significant heart or lung disease, a cervix with early dilation or <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fCervical_cerclage\" target=\"_blank\">cerclage</a> (a treatment for a weak cervix); multiple babies, multiple episodes of bleeding in the second and third trimesters, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ivillage.com%2fwhat-low-lying-placenta%2f6-n-138496\" target=\"_blank\">low lying placenta</a> after 26 weeks, premature labor during this pregnancy, or <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fsummahealth.staywellsolutionsonline.com%2fSearch%2f85%2cP01198\" target=\"_blank\">preeclampsia</a>. Even if you do not have any of these conditions, talk to your doctor before starting a new workout.</p>\n\
    <p>If you have never exercised before, walking, swimming, cycling, or aerobics are excellent ways to start. Begin exercising a minimum of 5 minutes per day, increasing your exercise time by 5 minutes per week. The goal is 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most to all days of the week.</p>\n\
    <p>For those regular athletes, continue your previous workout routine with modifications as needed.</p>\n\
    <p>Exercises to avoid: down-hill skiing, contact sports, scuba diving, horseback riding, or activities with jumping or sudden changes in direction. Pregnancy hormones cause relaxation of the ligaments in the back and pelvis, making you less stable than before pregnancy, so try new exercises cautiously. After the first trimester, avoid lying flat on your back. At this point, your uterus is large enough to compress the vein that brings blood up from your legs to your heart. When this vein is compressed, the baby\xE2\x80\x99s blood and oxygen are limited.</p>\n\
    <p>While exercising, wear a well fitting sports bra and comfortable clothing. Drink plenty of water before, during, and after the workout to keep you and baby hydrated. Continue exercising as long as you feel strong and stable. Reasons to stop exercising include: dizziness, near fainting, increasing shortness of breath, chest pain, headache, muscle weakness, calf pain, loss of fluid from the vagina, vaginal bleeding, contractions, or decreased fetal movement.</p>\n\
    <p>Talk to you physician about your workout plan before you start, and if you have questions along the way. Exercise is physically and mentally beneficial throughout pregnancy. Staying active during pregnancy will make it easier to workout after delivery, helping you to lose weight and keep up with your new little one!</p>\n\

    \t<p>The moment after you have a baby\xE2\x80\x94like when the kid\xE2\x80\x99s head crowns and he bungee jumps from your uterus\xE2\x80\x94you need to cry. It\xE2\x80\x99s expected. If slimy babies give you the heebie-jeebies, you can ask for the baby to be power-washed first, and then begin to cry. If you are watching <em>Love &amp; Hip Hop</em> and drinking a Slurpee because you\xE2\x80\x99ve had an epidural (my personal recommendation from the Labor &amp; Delivery menu) you can scream, \xE2\x80\x9CI can\xE2\x80\x99t feel my legs!\xE2\x80\x9D then laugh at your own joke, and begin to shake and cry.</p>\n\
    <p>What is not acceptable? Upon seeing that your healthy bundle only weighs five pounds and some change, yelling, \xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s it?! Nah, son. You have the wrong baby.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\
    <p>Hashtag: my life.</p>\n\
    <p>You see, Tophs was supposed to be a huge baby. Mostly because I had overshot my pregnancy weight limit by fifteen pounds and needed someone to blame. But also because Elie Mae had weighed over eight pounds, and second children and boys are typically bigger. \xE2\x80\x9CHe\xE2\x80\x99s not measuring very large,\xE2\x80\x9D my OB/<span class=\"caps\">GYN</span> had said at my prenatal appointments, but I\xE2\x80\x99d heard the same with Elie Mae, so I just smiled.</p>\n\
    <p>Even after the nurses weighed Tophs and placed him on my chest, I still held out hope. Perhaps I been dealt the hand of an obese placenta? I estimated in one out of every 12,000 pregnancies (rates are surely higher in West Virginia), the woman develops a placenta more than twice the necessary size.</p>\n\
    <p>Turns out my feeding sac was normal. At my four-week check up, I finally had to look my postpartum flab in the face, thanks to my OB:</p>\n\
    <p><span class=\"caps\">HIM</span>: <del>You\xE2\x80\x99re just going to feel my finger here.</del> How much did you weigh today?</p>\n\
    <p>ME: [I told him the real number. I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t lie because the nurse was still in the room.]</p>\n\
    <p><span class=\"caps\">HIM</span>: And how much did you weigh before you got pregnant?</p>\n\
    <p>ME: [Please make this stop. I\xE2\x80\x99d rather have back-to-back pap smears with a chilled speculum.]</p>\n\
    <p><span class=\"caps\">HIM</span>: <span class=\"caps\">WHOOPSIES</span>!</p>\n\
    <p>That word. A terrible word to say to an adult. I say \xE2\x80\x9CWhoopsies!\xE2\x80\x9D when Tophs lets one rip in his sleep&#8212;because it\xE2\x80\x99s not his fault. I would love to pretend that gaining extra pregnancy weight is like sleep farting. Really it\xE2\x80\x99s like throwing back whole rotisserie chickens and keeping a spit on your dashboard during rush hour.</p>\n\
    <p>My doc followed up with, \xE2\x80\x9CI tell patients to lose the weight within six months.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\
    <p>The clouds lifted. <em>Six months?</em> I wanted to hug him. I wanted to hug that White man and invite him to dinner and make a movie about it.</p>\n\
    <p>Time was on my side. In November, I would walk through his office doors in my skinny jeans, pulling my wagon of fat behind me like Oprah.</p>\n\
    <p>Turns out six months is not an eternity. Already it\xE2\x80\x99s September, and I\xE2\x80\x99ve got eight more pounds to lose. Given the urgency of my <em>sitchiation</em>, you\xE2\x80\x99d think I\xE2\x80\x99d be happy we live a few blocks from the biggest gym on Grounds.</p>\n\
    <p>Let me tell you why I\xE2\x80\x99m not.</p>\n\
    <p>This gym belongs to athletes and hotties. It belongs to the girls with lean, muscular legs and fluorescent Nikes. (Where is everyone getting those neon shoes?) These girls wear stretchy, spandexy, sexy outfits from Lululemon. These girls do not wear Umbro shorts. (Where can I buy a sturdy pair of Umbros?) They drink smoothies for dinner that make them like soooooo full! and give them, like, natural energy. I stay hooked to a Starbucks caffeine pump and try not to eat a morning bun <em>every</em> morning.</p>\n\
    <p>These girls scare me. At one point, I was hot like them. As an undergrad, I went to this gym once a year, the week before spring break. I climbed up on the elliptical as a size four, pumped Ludacris on my Discman and thought about which white shorts would look best in South Beach. But I\xE2\x80\x99m not eighteen anymore, and the only shorts I\xE2\x80\x99m wearing are called spanks, and if anyone sees them on any beach or street corner or grocery store line, I will die.</p>\n\
    <p>Did I mention I have a membership to this gym? Like we pay for me not to go. Paul has one, too, but it\xE2\x80\x99s different with guys. Guys gain a little gut, lose a little bicep, but no one notices. And even if someone does, she just falls deeper in love. Girls will be like, \xE2\x80\x9CAww, he doesn\xE2\x80\x99t have as much time to workout because he\xE2\x80\x99s a family man.\xE2\x80\x9D Those same girls will look at me and say, \xE2\x80\x9CShe needs to be grass-fed and tethered to a Nordic Track.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\
    <p>At twenty-nine, I\xE2\x80\x99m on the fence. I\xE2\x80\x99m young enough to look like a student but postpartum enough to squeeze my thighs together when I sneeze\xE2\x80\x94or else watch pee trickle down my leg. Instead of admitting I\xE2\x80\x99m insecure, I avoid the gym by claiming my needs have changed. My conversations with Paul go something like this:</p>\n\
    <p><span class=\"caps\">PAUL</span>: Do you wanna get out of the house and go to the gym?</p>\n\
    <p>ME: Nah, they don\xE2\x80\x99t have childcare.</p>\n\
    <p><span class=\"caps\">PAUL</span>: I\xE2\x80\x99m offering to stay home with the kids.</p>\n\
    <p>ME: Yeah, but I need to go to a class. You know, strength in numbers. The Army.</p>\n\
    <p><span class=\"caps\">PAUL</span>: Don\xE2\x80\x99t they offer classes at the gym?</p>\n\
    <p>ME: Yeah, but with skinny undergrads where you have to dance and stuff.</p>\n\
    <p>That last excuse is legit. They don\xE2\x80\x99t have what I need. If I were to open a gym for postpartum women, I would offer classes like Underwater Kegeling, Wave Goodbye to Turkey-Neck Arms, and Get That Cellulite Outa My Face. A lot of people would come to my gym.</p>\n\
    <p>I\xE2\x80\x99m sure if I actually went to the gym near our dorm, it wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t be so bad. But in my head, it\xE2\x80\x99s apocalyptic. Here\xE2\x80\x99s how it plays out: I walk in and a gorgeous girl is changing out of her sneakers into her Sperrys. I admire her brown top-siders. She says, \xE2\x80\x9CWant to try them on?\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CUm, no, that\xE2\x80\x99s okay, but if you insist, what size are you and do you have any nude footies?\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\
    <p>She wears a seven-and-a-half, so I take her right shoe, and I slip it on. The leather is tender, the little tie on the top so dainty yet boatishly rugged, and I smile. Until I walk to the full-length mirror and see what I have always known and yet in this moment have irresponsibly forgotten: I <span class=\"caps\">HAVE</span> <span class=\"caps\">CANKLES</span>.</p>\n\
    <p>It all goes black.</p>\n\
    <p>Sometimes the scenario plays out a little differently: Instead of Sperrys, the girl wears a sundress with cowboy boots that won\xE2\x80\x99t zip over my calves.</p>\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you need?\xE2\x80\x9D she asks. \xE2\x80\x9CWide-calf boots?\xE2\x80\x9D Then haunting laughter.</p>\n\
    <p>So you know, I have good reason not to go to the gym. Sperrys are real. <em>They are out there, man</em>. Plus, I have other exercising options\xE2\x80\x94like DVDs hosted by former <em>Biggest Loser</em> trainer Jillian Michaels.</p>\n\
    <p>Jillian gets me. She gets that I have saddlebags, muffin tops, and pancake boobs. She is all, \xE2\x80\x9CStick with me, and I will get rid of trouble zones.\xE2\x80\x9D She promises to blast out my fat.</p>\n\
    <p>I read somewhere that Jillian Michaels vowed never to have a baby because it would ruin her figure.</p>\n\
    <p>So maybe she doesn\xE2\x80\x99t get me. But, hey, she is into diversity. One of her backup stretchers is White; the other is Black. And she flirts with them equally. She\xE2\x80\x99s all, \xE2\x80\x9CGet back to your mat and stop tryin\xE2\x80\x99 to steal my thunder\xE2\x80\x9D to Salima, the Black girl.</p>\n\
    <p>Yes, I know the words. I even know how the fake bongos change tempo between the planks and push-ups. You start to hear hints of Donna Summer near the thrusting portion of the video. But there are no poles involved. I don\xE2\x80\x99t know that people with trouble zones do well on poles.</p>\n\
    <p>I am comfortable, safe at home in my makeshift gym. I close the blinds so the students can\xE2\x80\x99t see me holding my boobs while I do jumping jacks (They don\xE2\x80\x99t make steel bras like they used to). I do my girl pushups\xE2\x80\x94\xE2\x80\x9CBeginners, you can start on your knees if you need to and work your way up\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94on Elie Mae\xE2\x80\x99s play mat, in between Toph\xE2\x80\x99s bouncer and swing. No one can judge me because no one can see me. Except for Paul. I always call him over for the hip thrusts. Suddenly, I am Brittany from MTV\xE2\x80\x99s <em>Daria: Am I getting stron-ger, babe</em>?</p>\n\
    <p>But even as I eat more salads and less fro-yo and meet Jillian in the living room three nights a week after the kids go to bed, something still nags me. It\xE2\x80\x99s not just the weight. The weight will go, even if it takes longer than six months. Even if I have to endure another round of <span class=\"caps\">WHOOPSIES</span>! But there\xE2\x80\x99s this sense that I keep bumping up against a ghost of my younger, collegiate self. She\xE2\x80\x99s prettier, more confident, smarter, and more successful\xE2\x80\x94and I\xE2\x80\x99m not sure she ever existed. But even if she didn\xE2\x80\x99t, even if I sketched her from exaggerated memories of my time at <span class=\"caps\">UVA</span>, she is real now. She\xE2\x80\x99s there when I run into former professors who thought I\xE2\x80\x99d be getting my Ph.D. right about now. I see her when a fellow alum asks, \xE2\x80\x9CSo are you <em>just</em> a mom?\xE2\x80\x9D I feel her near when each time I answer, \xE2\x80\x9CSo what brings you back to Charlottesville?\xE2\x80\x9D with my husband\xE2\x80\x99s credentials and fail to mention it\xE2\x80\x99s a quirky, intellectual town that\xE2\x80\x99s great for the two callings I love: motherhood and writing.</p>\n\
    <p>At some point this semester, I will have to drag myself to the gym. But I will also have to take myself to that place where I decided the older me is less desirable than the younger me, and figure out how to make peace.</p>\n\

    <p><strong>The McDonald\xE2\x80\x99s Buckeye Recruits of the Week</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong><em>OFFENSE</em></strong><strong></strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Taivon Jacobs</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>WR, No. 1, Senior</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>5-10, 160 pounds</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Hometown: Forestville, Md.</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Suitland High School</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Verbally committed to Ohio State over Akron, Boston College, East Carolina, Florida State, Hawaii, Maryland, Miami (FL), Michigan State, Nebraska, North Carolina, N.C. State, Notre Dame, Pittsburgh, Wake Forest and West Virginia.</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>The Scoop: </strong>There is the <em>Massillon </em>Missile (this week\xE2\x80\x99s cover boy, WR Devin Smith), and then there is the <em>Maryland</em> Missile \xE2\x80\x93 WR Taivon Jacobs from Forestville, Md. \xE2\x80\x9CCoach Urban Meyer loves speed, and that\xE2\x80\x99s something that I\xE2\x80\x99ve got,\xE2\x80\x9D Jacobs told Rivals.com after verbally committing to Meyer and Ohio State back in July. The 400-meter sprinter from the Washington, D.C., area, who has been clocked in the 40-yard dash in 4.4 seconds, was a bit of a surprise<br>\n\
    commitment for Meyer and the Buckeyes. And that\xE2\x80\x99s because it was expected that Jacobs would follow his older brother, Levern, to the University of Maryland. But as Jacobs told ElevenWarriors.com, \xE2\x80\x9CI got a feeling that this is where I should be and I really liked the way the program is one big family at Ohio State. The people and the tradition there are great and the fan base is unbelievable.\xE2\x80\x9D Jacobs racked up 922 receiving yards and 13 touchdown grabs last year for Suitland High School. And he also returned seven kickoffs and punts for TDs. Yes, he\xE2\x80\x99s a special talent \xE2\x80\x93 a player who will likely play as a freshman in 2013, especially on special teams. And a player who Meyer will no doubt fully utilize in his up-tempo, spread offense.</p>\n\
    <p><strong><em>DEFENSE</em></strong></p>\n\

    <p><strong>DT, No. 54, Senior</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>6-4, 305 pounds</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Hometown: Youngstown, Ohio</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Austintown-Fitch High School</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Verbally committed to Ohio State over Miami (OH), Michigan, Michigan State, Nebraska, Notre Dame, Pittsburgh, Tennessee, UCLA and West Virginia.</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>The Scoop: </strong>Funny how future Ohio State DT Billy Price wears the number \xE2\x80\x9C54\xE2\x80\x9D on his Austintown-Fitch Falcons navy and scarlet jersey. Funny how Price hails from Youngstown \xE2\x80\x93 the hometown of current OSU Third Team All-American DL John Simon, who dons the number \xE2\x80\x9C54\xE2\x80\x9D on his Scarlet and Gray jersey. \xE2\x80\x9CThe dream of playing for the Scarlet and Gray first came to me when I was in about eighth grade watching Johnny Simon tear things up on the d-line when he was only a freshman in college. I told myself \xE2\x80\x93 \xE2\x80\x98I want to be that guy,\xE2\x80\x99 and play in an atmosphere like that.\xE2\x80\x9D So with team captain Simon leaving for the NFL after the 2012 season \xE2\x80\x93 as he\xE2\x80\x99s a senior, the freshman Price will be there in Columbus to fill his fellow Youngstowner\xE2\x80\x99s huge void during the 2013 season. And with Price on board with the Buckeyes next year, that will now make a total of eight of his own defensive line recruits Coach Urban Meyer will have on his roster. Price will be at the forefront of Meyer\xE2\x80\x99s defensive overhaul. And what a haul for Meyer that Price is \xE2\x80\x93 as Price is widely regarded as one of the top three prospects in the state of Ohio\xE2\x80\x99s class of 2013.</p>\n\n\n        </div></div>"

    <p><strong>The McDonald\xE2\x80\x99s Buckeye Players of the Week</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong><em>OFFENSE</em></strong><strong></strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Jordan Hall</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>RB, No. 7, Senior</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>5-9, 194 pounds</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Hometown: Jeannette, Pa.</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Jeannette High School</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>The Scoop: </strong>As hard as this is to believe, it\xE2\x80\x99s nevertheless true: RB Jordan Hall led Ohio State to a 29-15 win over UAB last week by rolling up a career high 105 rushing yards. Yes, you read that correctly \xE2\x80\x93 a \xE2\x80\x9Ccareer high\xE2\x80\x9D 105 rushing yards. Considering Hall is a senior Buckeye, you\xE2\x80\x99d figure he\xE2\x80\x99d have at least a game or two of plus 150 yards rushing under his belt. But that\xE2\x80\x99s the not case, and Hall\xE2\x80\x99s career best game also marks the first time an OSU running back has eclipsed 100 rushing yards this season. All surprise and awe aside, it was nice to see exactly that happen: a Buckeye back finally breakout and help QB Braxton Miller carry the offense. For the game, Hall averaged 6.2 yards per carry with a long run of 14 yards. He also grabbed two passes for another 21 yards. And the 17 total rushing attempts were just one carry away from Hall\xE2\x80\x99s career high of 18 he set last year during the 10-7 home loss to Michigan State \xE2\x80\x93 how ironic, as the Spartans are OSU\xE2\x80\x99s upcoming opponent and first Big Ten matchup of the young 2012 campaign.</p>\n\

    <p><strong>Hometown: Akron, Ohio</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>St. Vincent-St. Mary High School</strong></p>\n\
    <p><strong>The Scoop: </strong>The shoes were filled quite adequately in the \xE2\x80\x98Shoe. With Ohio State\xE2\x80\x99s ultra-talented CB Bradley Roby out with a shoulder injury, sophomore CB Doran Grant stepped up into Roby\xE2\x80\x99s shoes, and helped guide the Buckeyes to a 29-15 win over UAB last week in Ohio Stadium, or the \xE2\x80\x98Shoe, if you will. \xE2\x80\x9CI think I did okay,\xE2\x80\x9D Roby said after the game. \xE2\x80\x9CI just came in and did what I had to do in the absence of Bradley Roby and in helping the team in any way I could.\xE2\x80\x9D Yeah, you bet, Grant did \xE2\x80\x9Cokay.\xE2\x80\x9D Heck, he was more than \xE2\x80\x9Cokay.\xE2\x80\x9D As the speedy corner from the same high school as LeBron James rackedup a career high seven tackles (five of which were solo stops), recovered a fumble and intercepted UAB QB Austin Brown in the fourth quarter. \xE2\x80\x9CYou have to make plays,\xE2\x80\x9D Grant said after the game. \xE2\x80\x9CYou need to come in and know your work and go 100 percent every time.\xE2\x80\x9D Grant\xE2\x80\x99s two turnovers (the pick and fumble recovery) were the only ones the Buckeyes gained against UAB. And Grant also picked up OSU\xE2\x80\x99s lone sack of the game. Chances are we\xE2\x80\x99ll start seeing a lot more of Grant on the gridiron.</p>\n\n\n        </div></div>"

    <br>\n  \n  <p>Recent criticism of our work at Life Line Screening comes from an <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.guardian.co.uk%2fscience%2fblog%2f2012%2foct%2f05%2fprivate-health-screening-tests\" title=\"article written by physician and writer Margaret McCartney\" target=\"_blank\">article written by physician and writer Margaret McCartney</a>, along with her new site PrivateHealthScreening.org. Those of us at Life Line Screening understand there will always be debate about health screenings. We\xE2\x80\x99ve always offered high quality, convenient, affordable private screenings that individuals can voluntarily choose if they have appropriate risk factors and decide that the screenings are right for them.</p>\n\
    <p>Criticism of Life Line Screening fails to account for the context in which screenings are taking place. In the U.S., stroke is the <strong>fourth most common cause of death</strong> and is the leading cause of adult disability (1). This is just one statistic among many that prove we need new ideas and strategies to alter these alarming facts. Identifying serious underlying disease before it leads to a catastrophic event is surely better than waiting until the event happens.</p>\n\
    <p>Dr. McCartney mentions that she believes that carotid artery screening is only worthwhile once the person has already had a stroke.  This simply does not make any sense. And waiting for \xE2\x80\x9Csymptoms,\xE2\x80\x9D as she suggests, is also a poor strategy as most strokes come without any warning.  Only about 15% of people who have a stroke have a warning \xE2\x80\x9Cmini-stroke\xE2\x80\x9D ahead of time, so for the vast majority of people, the stroke comes out of the blue (2).</p>\n\
    <p>Also, never in this conversation has Dr. McCartney discussed the benefits of a person finding disease and seeing a doctor in time to put preventive strategies in place. While she is extremely focused on the little possibility of false-positives, she never allows for the opposite and even more powerful situation \xE2\x80\x93 someone coming in with something serious who is now able to work with his or her doctor to get back on the right path, thus possibly averting a serious crisis.  In fact, a recent paper showed that preventive screening and treatment for vascular disease risks resulted in 14% reduction in premature death and an 11% reduction in reliance on long-term care in comparison to those who did not participate in the study (3).</p>\n\
    <p>Life Line Screening has many <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.lifelinescreening.com%2fabout-us%2fpersonal-stories%2fdefault.aspx\" title=\"customer testimonials\">customer testimonials</a> to attest to our services and is actively engaged in research to better understand the utility and efficacy of screening (4, 5).  No screening is without risk, and any screening has a small, but certain risk of adverse outcomes as have any medicines or surgeries. On the basis of probabilities, however, its advantages far outweigh potential risks. </p>\n\
    <p>Dr. McCartney and others are certainly free to disagree.  However, to ignore the possibility that a model that promotes <strong>education </strong>and <strong>prevention </strong>can serve a vital role in the health care continuum is to do a disservice to the very patients she cares for. You\xE2\x80\x99ve seen both sides of the story. Educate yourself with the facts. View our video below to discern for yourself.</p>\n\n\

    <p>October is\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nbcam.org%2f\">National Breast Cancer Awareness Month</a>. One of the greatest challenges for those who have been newly diagnosed is finding sources of support.\xC2\xA0Patients are eager for information on everything from enduring surgery and chemotherapy to how to deal with hair loss.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>While there are many <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2farticles%2fbreast-cancer-support-groups-in-concord\">local resources and support groups available in Concord</a>, women can also find comfort in a sisterhood of survivors who have already been in their shoes.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Best selling author and breast cancer survivor\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fbarbaradelinsky.com%2f\">Barbara Delinsky</a>\xC2\xA0has gathered the wisdom of hundreds of breast cancer survivors who are eager to inspire those who are new to the \xE2\x80\x9Cbreast cancer sisterhood.\xE2\x80\x9D She shares all of the stories and tidbits she found in her book \"<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.amazon.com%2fUplift-Secrets-Sisterhood-Breast-Survivors%2fdp%2fB0078XOJUY\">Uplift: Secrets from the Sisterhood of Breast Cancer Survivors.</a><a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.amazon.com%2fUplift-Secrets-Sisterhood-Breast-Survivors%2fdp%2fB0078XOJUY\">\"</a></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>First published in 2001, the book was updated for a 10th anniversary edition published last year. Delinsky donates all the profits from the book to fund a research fellowship at\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.massgeneral.org%2f\">Massachusetts General Hospital</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Delinsky describes <i>\"</i>Uplift<i>\"</i> as a \xE2\x80\x9Ccomprehensive support group in a book form.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a handbook of practical tips and upbeat anecdotes that I compiled with the help of more than 400 breast cancer survivors, their families and friends. They gave me the book that I wish I\xE2\x80\x99d had way back when I was diagnosed.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Not everyone knows what to say when a friend or family member reveals a breast cancer diagnoses. Some of the women in <i>\"</i>Uplift\" shared that when people don\xE2\x80\x99t know what to say, they say nothing at all, which Delinsky says is the worst possible choice.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CA note, an email, a voicemail simply saying 'I\xE2\x80\x99m thinking of you' is the kindest thing in the world.\xE2\x80\x9D\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>When Delinsky was looking for answers to questions, she found \xE2\x80\x9Cnurses more informative when it came to answering mundane questions that weren\xE2\x80\x99t mundane to me at all.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Delinsky says look to your local hospital, faith organizations and even your workplace as potential sources of support.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9COne of the comments I got over and over again from contributors to 'Uplift' was that after they were diagnosed, women came out of the woodwork to say that they\xE2\x80\x99d been there, that they understood, that they wanted to help.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Delinsky says that she believes her life is better for having had breast cancer.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"I cherish my husband and kids more than ever. I view my grandchildren as a gift. And my career is frosting on the cake! So many of my 'Uplifters' [women she quotes in her book] have taken breast cancer as a wake-up call to appreciate their lives all the more, even dared to go back to school or do something entirely different with their lives.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Those who are newly diagnosed with breast cancer also should be \xE2\x80\x9Cuplifted\xE2\x80\x9D by the large sisterhood of survivors that have lived to share their wisdom, says Delinsky.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CWomen are surviving breast cancer in numbers that were unheard of a generation ago. We\xE2\x80\x99re being diagnosed earlier and being treated more effectively. More than 2.5 million women have had breast cancer and are now alive and well. Much of this is the result of mammography. Any woman who fears the 'pain' of mammography should know that five seconds of discomfort can lead to years and years of a longer life.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\

  title: "Romney or Obama: Who Won The Final Presidential Debate?"
  community_id: "34"

    <p>Massachusetts Republicans and Democrats both expressed confidence in their candidates after the final presidential debate, with Republicans citing Gov. Mitt Romney projecting an image of a \"capable Commander-in-Chief\" and Democrats citing President Barack Obama's line about the military having \"fewer horses and bayonets\" as standout moments: that's the major finding of the Red and Blue Commonwealth flash polls sent out to local politicos immediately after the debate ended on Monday night.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Obama and Romney faced off Monday night at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla., with CBS's Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer moderating a debate that focused on foreign policy, but regularly delved back into domestic policy differences between the candidates.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Of the 21 local influential Republicans who took the flash poll, six (28.6 percent) said Romney won by a large margin, 12 (57.1 percent) said he won by a slim margin, two called the debate neutral and one voted that Obama won by a wide margin.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>On the other side, 22 local influential Democrats took the flash poll and 17 (77.3 percent) said Obama won by a wide margin, two said he won by a slim margin and three called the debate neutral.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Democrats surveyed also overwhelmingly said that Obama would be the consensus \"winner\" as declared by the national media: nine (40.9 percent) said by a wide margin and 12 (54.6 percent) said by a slim margin, while one said Romney by a slim margin.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Republicans surveyed were somewhat evenly divided on who they thought would be the consensus \"winner\" as declared by the national media: six (28.6 percent) said Romney by a slim margin, another six said it'd be neutral, 5 (23.8 percent) said Obama by a slim margin and four (19.1 percent) said Obama by a wide margin.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><h2>'Failed Policies' Versus a Military Equipment Zinger</h2><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Asked what moment would stand out in the minds of conservatives in Massachusetts, several local Republicans pointed to Romney attacking Obama's policies as president, while also saying the GOP nominee projected a strong and presidential presence.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Mitt looks like a Commander-in-Chief, Obama is still explaining his failed policies,\" one Republican poll taker wrote.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Another local Republican cited Romney's response when Obama said that the nation cannot \"go back to the same policies\" that led to the nation's difficult economic situation and needs to go forward.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t agree more about going forward,\" Romney replied, \"but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years ...\xC2\xA0It's just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous as ours that these last four years have been so hard.\"\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Asked what moment would stand out in the minds of progressives and liberals in Massachusetts, several local Democrats pointed to Obama's retort when Romney said that the U.S. Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"We also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed,\" Obama said. \"We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.\xC2\xA0And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting ships. It's what are our capabilities.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Other Democrats cited Obama attacking Romney's previously stated positions, which they characterized as \"flip-flops.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><h2>What About Swing Voters?</h2><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Asked what moment would stand out in the mind of swing voters in Massachusetts, some Democrats again cited the \"horses and bayonets\" line, while others pointed to Romney \"so often agreeing\" with Obama on foreign policy issues.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Romney backing off from every criticism of the President's foreign policy,\" one Democrat respondent wrote. \"And his closing, talking repeatedly about peace as if reciting something memorized. And not answering the President's comments about his campaign. He came out as if trying to get by and not make any waves.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>One local Republican also said that \"horses and bayonets line was memorable;\" however, one local Democrat said that Bay State swing voters would remember \"how calm and clear Romney was in his statements.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Other local Republicans cited Romney touting his ability to work with Democrats from his time as governor of Massachusetts, while others pointed to him repeatedly bringing the topic back to the question of the economy.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Twenty-three million Americans out of work and food stamps at an all-time high\xE2\x80\x94Obama has had four years to improve it and failed,\" one Republican respondent wrote.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><h2>Will the Debate Make a Difference?</h2><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Both sides believed that their candidate's performance would increase the number of votes their candidate would win in Massachusetts.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Eight local Republicans (38.1 percent) said they strongly agreed Romney's performance would increase his tally of Bay State votes, another eight somewhat agreed, four (19.1 percent) were neutral and one strongly disagreed.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Eleven local Democrats (50 percent) said they strongly agreed Obama's performance would boost his Massachusetts vote totals, eight (36.4 percent) somewhat agreed and three were neutral.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In final remarks, both sides returned to previous themes, with several Republicans citing Romney's \"statesman\" demeanor, which they contrasted with Obama's \"defensive\" and \"disruptive, undisciplined\" demeanor.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Several Democrats again cited Romney's \"etch-a-sketch treatment of a previous statement,\" as one respondent put it, and that Romney \"parroted\" Obama \"on most of his policies.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>That said, one person on each side of the aisle said that both candidates performed well, while another looked forward to Nov. 7, the day <em>after</em> the election.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Glad it's over,\" the respondent wrote. \"Now let's get through the next two weeks!\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong><em>Who do you think won the debate? Tell us in the comments below.</em></strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Red and Blue Commonwealth Surveys</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Our surveys are not a scientific, random sample of any larger population, but rather an effort to listen to a group of influential local Republican activists, party leaders, candidates and elected officials in Massachusetts. All of these individuals have agreed to participate in Massachusetts' Patch's surveys, although not all responded to this story's questions.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Patch will be conducting Red Commonwealth and Blue Commonwealth surveys throughout the 2012 election season in hopes of determining the true sentiment of conservatives and liberals on the ground in Massachusetts. If you are an activist, party leader or elected official and would like to take part in periodic surveys that last just a few minutes, please contact Associate Regional Editor Daniel DeMaina at danield@patch.com.</p>\n\

    </p><p>Oh, man, wasn\xE2\x80\x99t this weekend\xE2\x80\x99s weather simply superb?? I just love days like that in the middle of autumn; they take you by surprise and make you all happy. SO nice to be outside, enjoying the sunshine, especially after the crazy rain on Friday.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>For anyone who didn\xE2\x80\x99t make it over to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.westconcordvillage.org%2f\">Discover West Concord Village Day</a>, well, I feel very sad for you, because you missed a great party. I don\xE2\x80\x99t always go to events like this, especially on a Saturday when I\xE2\x80\x99m mostly driving from one sporting event to the next. But I decided to carve out an hour to go check it out, ended up spending two, and never made it past the railroad tracks. Which is unfortunate, because I didn\xE2\x80\x99t make it to the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vintagesonline.com%2f\">Vintages </a>wine tasting, or any other delectable delights up that way.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>I DID, however, manage to hit <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fdebrasnaturalgourmet.com%2f\">Debra\xE2\x80\x99s Natural Gourmet</a>, which was celebrating their birthday. It was chock-full of vendors offering samples of everything from vegan seafood to muesli. I personally sampled dried figs, chocolate, granola, bratwurst, chocolate, cheese, tea, chocolate \xE2\x80\x93 let\xE2\x80\x99s just say, enough food that it became my lunch. Oh, and birthday cake! I have a policy of never saying no to cake, and this was worth every bite.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>There was music on the porch of <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cheerful-reasons.com%2f\">Reasons To Be Cheerful</a>, and a table of organic wares from a woman getting ready to open a new store next to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.concordoutfitters.com%2f\">Concord Outfitters</a> (more on that later). And back on Beharrell Street, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.1on1si.com%2f\">1 on 1 Self Indulgence </a>was offering hand treatments and chair massages, while a performance of a Chinese dragon and drums happened nearby. Oh, and there was this really fun group of women from <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.yogaandniaforlife.com\">Yoga &amp; Nia for for Life</a> who danced in the street! They were SO fun to watch, and if I had any ability to move my feet in some synchronized manner, I would have totally joined them.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The weather cooperated beautifully to make this a spectacular event. And later, I heard that the Cocoa House at RTBC was a rousing success, with more people crammed in than ever before. All in all, a fabulous time was had by all over in West Concord \xE2\x80\x93 kudos to the people who worked hard and pulled it off!</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b><i>Welcome back, Judith!</i></b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>My good friend Judith Broggi is back in town. I told you all about her oh-so-interesting career path <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2farticles%2fsame-skills-new-career\">here</a>. She spent the summer back in her old stomping grounds of Chicago, doing some consulting at their very fine Art Institute, but has now returned to resume her Park Ranger duties here in town. She is also taking her passion for farming and channeling it into a community blog on the pages of wickedlocal, titled <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.wickedlocal.com%2fconcord%2fblog%2fbackforty\">\xE2\x80\x9CLife Begins at the Back Forty.\xE2\x80\x9D</a> If you, too, have an interest in farming and history, check out her writing; it\xE2\x80\x99s entertaining as well as informative.

  content: "<div><div>\n\
    <p>Generally speaking, a woman Massachusetts has a 133 in 100,000 chance of getting breast cancer, according to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fww5.komen.org%2fBreastCancer%2fStatistics.html%23USvar\">this</a> breast cancer statistics chart from <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fww5.komen.org%2f\">komen.org</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>An American woman in her 30s has a one in 232 chance of getting the disease, and a woman 20 years her senior has a one in 42 probability, according to the website.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CAlthough we aren\xE2\x80\x99t certain, the cause of breast cancer in younger women is likely caused by a genetic predisposition,\xE2\x80\x9D says Ann H. Partridge, M.D., M.P.H., the medical oncologist director of the Adult Survivorship Program at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women\xE2\x80\x99s Hospital.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>While <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fww5.komen.org%2fBreastCancer%2fYoungWomenandBreastCancer.html\">breast cancer treatment in young women</a> is often effective, the chance of recovery\xC2\xA0tends to be worse in women under 40. Breast tissue is often denser in younger women, making cancer harder to detect initially.<b> <br></b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>This is why many younger women are diagnosed at later stages with more aggressive tumors. These factors all contribute to an increased need for stronger <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cancer.gov%2fcancertopics%2fpdq%2ftreatment%2fbreast%2fPatient%2fpage6\">treatments</a>, says Partridge.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Unfortunately, some of these therapies have side effects that hit younger women in different and sometimes more difficult ways than their older counterparts.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>At the time of diagnosis, many young women are in the midst of building careers, getting married and starting families. A major concern for young women with breast cancer is loss of fertility. Both chemo and hormone therapies can damage the ovaries, causing irregular periods or a menopausal transition.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>For women in their 20s and 30s who continue to have their periods after chemotherapy, the ability to have children is still possible. Women who may want to become a parent after breast cancer should speak with their doctor about their options before choosing a treatment.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    &#13;\n\
    </p><p>Those who are diagnosed after starting families also face unique challenges.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CIt was difficult being 25 years old and finding out I had breast cancer, but it was even harder to figure out how to explain what was going on to my four-year-old son,\xE2\x80\x9D\xC2\xA0says Crystal King, an eight-year survivor and the manager of multicultural marketing for <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.circleofpromise.org%2f\">Susan G. Komen for the Cure Circle of Promise</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Another source of distress among young women with breast cancer is the way their appearance will be affected by treatments.\xC2\xA0Healthy or not, a woman's happiness with her breast size and shape can have an impact on her overall body image.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>Police were called to the Convenient 38 in Woburn Oct. 12 for a report of an assault. According to police, a woman stated she was in line with her three-year-old son, holding his hand, when the toddler shouted \xE2\x80\x9Che punched me, he punched me.\xE2\x80\x9D The child told his mother that one of four teenaged boys leaving the store had hit him in the face. Police spoke to the youths, who denied touching the boy. The responding officer told the woman that it was \xE2\x80\x9Chighly unlikely\xE2\x80\x9D that a teenager would hit a toddler holding his mother\xE2\x80\x99s hand and the woman agreed.\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpatch.com%2fA-yCMP\">http://patch.com/A-yCMP</a></p><p>&#13;\n\

When police arrived, a witness said the man had kicked over a headstone of a man who died in 1867 and had been cutting tree branches on the property. Police quickly caught up with the suspect and found him sitting on a gravestone. He told police he was playing hide and seek in the cemetary, but police did not see anybody else playing the game.\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpatch.com%2fA-yHLj\">http://patch.com/A-yHLj</a>\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>He was born on September 18, 1917, the son of the late Edward F. Flint Sr and Josephine (Ritchie) Flint. Henry was also the brother of the late Edward F. Flint Jr, Margaret R. Delling, and Charlotte H. Flint. \xC2\xA0Henry graduated Cambridge School 1935, taking additional courses at Franklin Institute, Boston, Boston University, M.I.T., Cambridge, and Northeastern University, Boston. \xC2\xA0He operated his father\xE2\x80\x99s farm from 1935- 1945. He was later employed by Trans-Sonic., Minneapolis-Honeywell Co. and Baird Atomic Co. Henry was a long-time member of the Appalachian Mountain Club and of the First Parish Church, Lincoln, MA. Henry was a life-long bachelor.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Henry\xE2\x80\x99s life-long passion for the natural world kept him outside as often as possible. In his younger years, Henry enjoyed hiking and skiing in the White Mountains and swimming and boating in Farrar Pond with friends. Henry\xE2\x80\x99s decision to stay on the family farm proved him to be both a loyal son, and a true Flint. Henry worked in the family McIntosh apple orchard and the farm greenhouses.\xC2\xA0 The delicate stevia flower was one of the primary crops, used in flower arrangements and sold at the Boston Flower Market during the early morning auctions. One of Henry\xE2\x80\x99s proudest \xC2\xA0moments was being awarded, by Henry Ford himself,\xC2\xA0 his beloved \xE2\x80\x9CSophia,\xE2\x80\x9D a Ford 9N tractor, in the New England Regional tractor operating finals in October of 1940, when a member of the National Farm Youth Foundation.\xC2\xA0 Henry\xE2\x80\x99s mental ability and mechanical aptitude helped him in the winning of the contest when he corrected the settings of the supplied equipment, and wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t let the rain slow him down. \xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In his later years, when slowed down by physical limitations, plowing the winter snows, mowing his lawn, tending his garden beds and keeping an eye on his bluebird houses brought Henry enormous pleasure. He was once heard to say that flowers and birds were the 8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> Wonders of the World. Henry delighted in memorizing poetry and scripture, keeping his mind sharp while reciting favorite writings over and over again. \xC2\xA0William Bryant\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9CTo a Waterfowl\xE2\x80\x9D was \xE2\x80\x9Cmemorized by heart when moving pots in the greenhouses.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xC2\xA0Despite the challenges he faced, Henry remained ferociously independent and totally uncomplaining. He was full of childhood stories of growing up on the farm, full of good humor, and was always more concerned about others and how life was going for them.\xC2\xA0 He was grateful for the sight of friends stopping by for a visit. (The door to his home was always open, or you could find the key outside in a plastic container to the right of the door.) \xC2\xA0Henry will be dearly missed by the many who were inspired by his stalwart attitude to \xE2\x80\x9CKeep on keepin\xE2\x80\x99 on!\xE2\x80\x9D He is survived by nieces and cousins.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Memorial Service, Saturday, November 17th at 2:00 p.m. in The First Parish in Lincoln, Bedford Rd., Lincoln. Interment was private in the family burial plot in Lincoln Cemetery.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>Halloween is less than two weeks away, so we're devoting this edition of Patch Picks to the upcoming haunted holiday.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>In my opinion, the best Halloween costumes are the ones that are homemade. It's fun to make your own costume, and can be an affordable option if you stick to items you already have around your house. Not to mention, you get to put your creative genius (or kids) to work.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Here are my picks for the best homemade Halloween costumes:</p><p>&#13;
    </p><ul><li><strong>God's Gift to Men/Women:</strong> This can be as simple or as elaborate as you'd like. Take a few cardboard boxes and used the material to make a you-sized box. Cut a head and arm holes in it. Then wrap the box in your favorite wrapping paper. Get in. Complete your outfit with a ribbon on your head and a giant gift tag that says: "To: Men, From: God." I won a costume contest with this one in 2006.</li>&#13;
    <li><strong>A Mummy: </strong>I was a mummy the year I wanted to put about 10 minutes of time into crafting a costume. All you need? Toilet paper. Do it yourself, or have someone help, by wrapping toilet paper all around you. Then go crazy with face paint or makeup to finish the effect. </li>&#13;
    <li><strong>Go Political:</strong> It's a great year to go as Mitt Romney or Barack Obama (maybe even Big Bird?) Just dress up in a suit and tie and carry props such as a binder (for Mitt) or a birth certificate (for The Prez). </li>&#13;
    <li><strong>Thrift Store Threads:</strong> Thrift stores are great places to find cheap, fun costume ideas. Think '80s snowsuits, lumberjack flannels or adult onesie pajamas. I even found an Easter bunny costume at a thrift store one time for $9. Major score.</li>&#13;
    <li><strong>Giant Pumpkin:</strong> You know those lawn leaf bags in the shape of a pumpkin? They make a great costume. Just cut leg, arm and head holes in the bag, reinforce the holes with tape so they don't rip, and fill with you, plus leaves, tissue paper or newspaper. </li>&#13;
    <li><strong>Jelly Bean Jar: </strong>Find a clear garbage bag and make it wearable following the steps in the "Giant Pumpkin" costume above. Blow up a bunch of balloons and stuff the bag. Write "Jelly Beans $.10" with a Sharpie and you're good to go.</li>&#13;
    &#13;
    </ul><p>I'm sure there are tons of other homemade Halloween costume ideas out there. <strong>Add yours in the comments!</strong></p>

    </p><p>Franken was in Massachusetts Oct. 19 to support <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fnorwood.patch.com%2farticles%2fnew-poll-gives-warren-a-6-point-advantage-over-brown-obama-leads-in-mass-by-14-points-60316c27\">Elizabeth Warren, the U.S. Senate candidate looking to unseat the Scott Brown</a>, the Republican incumbent, in a tight race many politicos expect will have ramifications far beyond the Commonwealth\xE2\x80\x99s borders. And the stumping stopped in Lexington Friday afternoon, whereFranken and U.S. Rep Ed Markey joined a few more familiar faces to address an overflowing crowd at the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexington.patch.com%2flistings%2flexington-depot\">Depot building</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>There were jokes aplenty, for sure, but the message was a serious one, and the importance of this race\xE2\x80\x94between Brown and Warren\xE2\x80\x94for Democrats, resonated in all remarks delivered before a highly partisan crowd.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Hanging in the balance is not just one seat representing one of the nation\xE2\x80\x99s bluest states, but also the future of the environment, middle class, Supreme Court and several key committees, the speakers said.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9COnce again it all comes down to Massachusetts; would you want it any other way?\xE2\x80\x9D said Markey. \xE2\x80\x9CMany people are saying, \xE2\x80\x98How big is this race?\xE2\x80\x99 Well, let\xE2\x80\x99s be honest. We are at one of those turning points in history, and this race between Scott Brown and Elizabeth Warren could determine which party controls the United States Senate.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>To \xE2\x80\x9Coohs\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cahhs\xE2\x80\x9D from the crowd, Markey went through the committees appointments that could be affected by the Brown-Warren race, including the Judiciary Committee, the Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources and the Environment and Public Works.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>While the environment was a big focus, and Franken also spoke about the impacts this race could have on the economy, calling Warren a \xE2\x80\x9Csiren\xE2\x80\x9D for the \xE2\x80\x9Csqueeze of the middle class,\xE2\x80\x9D and the Supreme Court.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CWe need someone from Massachusetts who knows that there\xE2\x80\x99s a difference between [Justice Antonin] Scalia and [Justice Sonia Sotamayor,\xE2\x80\x9D said Franken, riffing on <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.salon.com%2f2012%2f10%2f02%2fscott_brown_has_many_favorite_supreme_ct_justices%2f\">Brown's muddled response during a recent debate</a>. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd that [Justice Elena] Kagan is much more like Sotamayor than Scalia. Elizabeth, I hope is on Judiciary.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In closing, Franken, who won his seat by just 312 votes in 2008, implored Warren supporters to hit the streets in support of their candidate, even joking that it\xE2\x80\x99s OK to forget about their jobs and families because kids are resilient and 8-year-olds can not only use microwaves, but can teach 4-year-olds how to use them.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CMassachusetts is not going to control who goes to the White House,\xE2\x80\x9D Franken said. \xE2\x80\x9CBut we need to hold the Senate, we do know that, and that is within your control.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Also speaking at the event were state Rep. Jay Kaurman, D-Lexington, state Sen. Ken Donnelly, D-Arlington, and state Senate candidate Mike Barrett, D-Lexington.\xC2\xA0</p>\n\

The best of the Gold<br>recipients is designated the National GRAMMY Signature School. For schools that<br>are economically underserved, the GRAMMY Foundation established the <b>Enterprise Award</b> category to recognize<br>the efforts in music education made by these schools.. GRAMMY Signature Schools<br>recipients are determined by the Blue Ribbon Committee, a panel of top music<br>educators and professionals.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p><br>The GRAMMY Foundation was established in 1989 to cultivate<br>the understanding, appreciation and advancement of the contribution of recorded<br>music to American culture \xE2\x80\x94 from the artistic and technical legends of the past<br>to the still unimagined musical breakthroughs of future generations of music<br>professionals.

    </p><p>One Angel Foundation announces its 2<sup>nd</sup> Annual World Hike A Mountain Day on October 20, 2012 at Mount Wachusett in Princeton, Massachusetts. One Angel Foundation\xE2\x80\x99s mission is to help children and their communities mired in poverty by creating a model program that gives communities hope that during their lifetime poverty will be only a memory.\xC2\xA0 Last year approximately 400 hikers joined us at 18 US locations and 7 international locations for our 1<sup>st</sup> Annual World Hike A Mountain Day.\xC2\xA0 Please join us at Mt Wachusett. Registration and donation information can be found at <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.oneangelfoundation.org\">www.oneangelfoundation.org</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>One Angel Foundation was formed in honor of Jenna Agule, who passed away prematurely at 22 years old.\xC2\xA0 One Angel was created by friends and family with the hope of continuing her commitment to community service internationally by bringing hope and a smile to children in need around the world.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The monies raised last year from this event went to help complete a bi-lingual middle school in Julticalpa Honduras and a toy room in an AIDS Hospice at an orphanage in Capetown. Our goal this year is to begin to create a model community in Julticalpa Honduras of small compact homes that have common sewage, water and power all located on a small lot of 2-5 acres. Homes would be duplex in style and would contain approximately 500-600 SF each. Each of the homes would contain a small kitchen, bath, sleeping area and living area. Funds raised this year will be used to help fund in part the commencement of this community. Please go to our website: <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.oneangelfoundation.org\">www.oneangelfoundation.org</a> for more information. Registration information can be found at: http://www.active.com/outdoors/princeton-ma/world-hike-a-mountain-day-2012</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>While the hike at Mt Wachusett will serve as a festive home base for Hike A Mountain Day with a farmer\xE2\x80\x99s market, craft fair, family entertainment, sky rides to the summit and much more, participants will also be hiking all over the world at other host locations to fundraise for our mission.\xC2\xA0 Potential participants that are unable to travel to Mt. Wachusett for World Hike A Mountain Day are encouraged to hike at a mountain or trail near them.\xC2\xA0 Agule was a world traveler, hiking enthusiast and dedicated philanthropist who often hiked Mt. Wachusett and also traveled to Julticalpa for community service projects in the area. World Hike A Mountain Day honors Agule\xE2\x80\x99s love of nature and commitment to bringing hope &amp; a smile to families and children around the world.</p></div></div>"

  community_id: "30"

    <p>Massachusetts Republicans and Democrats both expressed confidence in their candidates after the final presidential debate, with Republicans citing Gov. Mitt Romney projecting an image of a \"capable Commander-in-Chief\" and Democrats citing President Barack Obama's line about the military having \"fewer horses and bayonets\" as standout moments: that's the major finding of the Red and Blue Commonwealth flash polls sent out to local politicos immediately after the debate ended on Monday night.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Obama and Romney faced off Monday night at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla., with CBS's Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer moderating a debate that focused on foreign policy, but regularly delved back into domestic policy differences between the candidates.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Of the 21 local influential Republicans who took the flash poll, six (28.6 percent) said Romney won by a large margin, 12 (57.1 percent) said he won by a slim margin, two called the debate neutral and one voted that Obama won by a wide margin.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>On the other side, 22 local influential Democrats took the flash poll and 17 (77.3 percent) said Obama won by a wide margin, two said he won by a slim margin and three called the debate neutral.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Democrats surveyed also overwhelmingly said that Obama would be the consensus \"winner\" as declared by the national media: nine (40.9 percent) said by a wide margin and 12 (54.6 percent) said by a slim margin, while one said Romney by a slim margin.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Republicans surveyed were somewhat evenly divided on who they thought would be the consensus \"winner\" as declared by the national media: six (28.6 percent) said Romney by a slim margin, another six said it'd be neutral, 5 (23.8 percent) said Obama by a slim margin and four (19.1 percent) said Obama by a wide margin.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><h2>'Failed Policies' Versus a Military Equipment Zinger</h2><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Asked what moment would stand out in the minds of conservatives in Massachusetts, several local Republicans pointed to Romney attacking Obama's policies as president, while also saying the GOP nominee projected a strong and presidential presence.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Mitt looks like a Commander-in-Chief, Obama is still explaining his failed policies,\" one Republican poll taker wrote.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Another local Republican cited Romney's response when Obama said that the nation cannot \"go back to the same policies\" that led to the nation's difficult economic situation and needs to go forward.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t agree more about going forward,\" Romney replied, \"but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years ...\xC2\xA0It's just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous as ours that these last four years have been so hard.\"\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Asked what moment would stand out in the minds of progressives and liberals in Massachusetts, several local Democrats pointed to Obama's retort when Romney said that the U.S. Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"We also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed,\" Obama said. \"We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.\xC2\xA0And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting ships. It's what are our capabilities.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Other Democrats cited Obama attacking Romney's previously stated positions, which they characterized as \"flip-flops.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><h2>What About Swing Voters?</h2><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Asked what moment would stand out in the mind of swing voters in Massachusetts, some Democrats again cited the \"horses and bayonets\" line, while others pointed to Romney \"so often agreeing\" with Obama on foreign policy issues.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Romney backing off from every criticism of the President's foreign policy,\" one Democrat respondent wrote. \"And his closing, talking repeatedly about peace as if reciting something memorized. And not answering the President's comments about his campaign. He came out as if trying to get by and not make any waves.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>One local Republican also said that \"horses and bayonets line was memorable;\" however, one local Democrat said that Bay State swing voters would remember \"how calm and clear Romney was in his statements.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Other local Republicans cited Romney touting his ability to work with Democrats from his time as governor of Massachusetts, while others pointed to him repeatedly bringing the topic back to the question of the economy.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Twenty-three million Americans out of work and food stamps at an all-time high\xE2\x80\x94Obama has had four years to improve it and failed,\" one Republican respondent wrote.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><h2>Will the Debate Make a Difference?</h2><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Both sides believed that their candidate's performance would increase the number of votes their candidate would win in Massachusetts.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Eight local Republicans (38.1 percent) said they strongly agreed Romney's performance would increase his tally of Bay State votes, another eight somewhat agreed, four (19.1 percent) were neutral and one strongly disagreed.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Eleven local Democrats (50 percent) said they strongly agreed Obama's performance would boost his Massachusetts vote totals, eight (36.4 percent) somewhat agreed and three were neutral.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In final remarks, both sides returned to previous themes, with several Republicans citing Romney's \"statesman\" demeanor, which they contrasted with Obama's \"defensive\" and \"disruptive, undisciplined\" demeanor.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Several Democrats again cited Romney's \"etch-a-sketch treatment of a previous statement,\" as one respondent put it, and that Romney \"parroted\" Obama \"on most of his policies.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>That said, one person on each side of the aisle said that both candidates performed well, while another looked forward to Nov. 7, the day <em>after</em> the election.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Glad it's over,\" the respondent wrote. \"Now let's get through the next two weeks!\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong><em>Who do you think won the debate? Tell us in the comments below.</em></strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Red and Blue Commonwealth Surveys</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Our surveys are not a scientific, random sample of any larger population, but rather an effort to listen to a group of influential local Republican activists, party leaders, candidates and elected officials in Massachusetts. All of these individuals have agreed to participate in Massachusetts' Patch's surveys, although not all responded to this story's questions.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Patch will be conducting Red Commonwealth and Blue Commonwealth surveys throughout the 2012 election season in hopes of determining the true sentiment of conservatives and liberals on the ground in Massachusetts. If you are an activist, party leader or elected official and would like to take part in periodic surveys that last just a few minutes, please contact Associate Regional Editor Daniel DeMaina at danield@patch.com.</p>\n\

    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CFor several years, I\xE2\x80\x99ve strived to create a significant way to give my music purpose. <b>\xE2\x80\x98til the Cure is Won</b> is a direct result of that effort. I wrote it on a day when I felt powerless to change what was happening to someone I loved. I hope the song will bring comfort and inspiration to everyone who hears it,\xE2\x80\x9D said Belitsky.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>\xE2\x80\x98til the Cure is Won</b> speaks to the hearts of those suffering from serious illness, as well as to the people who long to comfort them.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Belitsky began singing in nightclubs in the U.S. and Canada while still in her teens.

Paul Canfield said about 100 police officers will be in the downtown Kent area Saturday night, with officers from the Brimfield Police Department, Kent State University Police Department, Metro SWAT, the Ohio Highway Patrol and the Portage County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office assisting the city of Kent.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;As in years past, folks should plan on seeing a significant police presence in and around the downtown area,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;(People) should avoid driving through downtown Saturday night,&rdquo; Canfield said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always bumper to bumper.&rdquo;</p><p>He said people who plan on parking downtown should lock their vehicles, hide any valuables and travel in groups during the event.</p><p>Canfield said costumed visitors to downtown should also think twice before they bring accessories, advising revelers planning to bring anything that could be considered a weapon to leave it at home.</p><p>&ldquo;Please do not bring anything that resembles a weapon,&rdquo; Canfield said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen everything from people who have life-like replicas of guns to actual swords and hatchets.&rdquo;</p><p>He said people carrying life-like or actual weapons downtown would receive full police attention and possibly face criminal charges.</p><p>Beder said life-like weapons are one of the few reasons a patron may be barred from entry to Water Street Tavern or other downtown establishments.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a busy night and there&rsquo;s so many people out that we really don&rsquo;t make any exceptions,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If your face is painted to the point that we can&rsquo;t identify you by your ID, then we can&rsquo;t let you in. If a costume is too large or potentially hazardous, we don&rsquo;t let you in.&rdquo;</p><p>Beder said highly offensive costumes, such as a machine gun-wielding Osama Bin Laden that tried in the past, don&rsquo;t make it through the door either.</p><p>&ldquo;We want to make sure everyone is safe and comfortable and has a good time.&rdquo;</p><p>With all the changes and growth that has occurred in downtown Kent during the past year, Kent Area Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Lori Wemhoff recommends folks come early and see the changes.</p><p>&ldquo;With so much going on downtown these days, Saturday would be an ideal time for people to come down early and see the evolution of downtown Kent up close and personal,&rdquo; Wemhoff said. &ldquo;The increased foot traffic during the day and in the evenings has been great to see, I encourage anyone planning to come downtown on Saturday to come early to shop and eat local.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Contact Kyle McDonald at 330-298-1127 or <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.recordpub.com%2fnews%2farticle%2fmailto%3akmcdonald%40recordpub.com">kmcdonald@recordpub.com</a><br></em></p><p><em>Contact Thomas Gallick at 330-298-1127 or <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.recordpub.com%2fnews%2farticle%2fmailto%3atgallick%40recordpub.com">tgallick@recordpub.com</a></em></p></p>

    							<p>AKRON -- Police are seeking the suspects involved in two separate&nbsp;crimes that took place on Tuesday.</p>
    <p>The first happened shortly after 8 a.m. at the Six Corner's Deli in the 700 block of Eastland Avenue. According to Akron Police, an employee reported that two males entered the deli. One of the suspects approached the counter, pulled out a haundgun and demanded money from the register, while the other stayed by the door.</p>
    <p>The clerk reportedly opened the register and said she didn't have any money and both suspects fled the store southbound on Eastland Avenue empty-handed.</p>
    <p>The second&nbsp;incident occurred shortly before 9 p.m. as resident in the 2000 block of 18th Street SW reported they were the victims of a home invasion. The resident reported that two males, both armed with guns, entered the house and demanded that they get down on the floor. The suspects then demanded their money and cell phones.</p>
    <p>Although no injuries were reported, the suspects fled the scene with $5,000 cash and eight cell phones.</p>
    <p>Anybody with information in either incident is asked to contact Akron Police.</p>

    <p>The latest track of Hurricane Sandy has the storm pushing farther west according to this morning\xE2\x80\x99s meteorologists' reports. The National Hurricane Center has the center of the storm going either into southern New Jersey or Delaware.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>But this is a constantly changing storm, and a more northern track, which is possible, would signficicantly affect us here in New England.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>According to WHDH Meteorologist <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww1.whdh.com%2fweather%2fblog%2fpage%2f1%2f\">Chris Lambert,</a> the current likely scenario would bring wind and rain Monday afternoon through Tuesday with wind gusts of 40-60 mph, mostly onshore, strongest at the coast with up to 5 inches of rain expected throughout the storm\xE2\x80\x99s duration. Power outages are likely, along with beach erosion and coastal flooding during high tides.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Lambert says it\xE2\x80\x99s still a \xE2\x80\x9Cvery complicated and anomalous pattern\xE2\x80\x9D and thus the timing is tricky.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>If Sandy maintains a warm core longer into the forecast period, it may hold on longer than some of the models project. If that happens, the turn northwest into the coast would happen farther north and put southern New England in a more serious situation than the current path would take it. \xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nhc.noaa.gov%2ftext%2frefresh%2fMIATCPAT3%2bshtml%2f260848.shtml\">National Hurricane Center </a>has the hurricane currently with sustained winds of 80 mph, moving north at 13 mph. The storm is expected to decrease in speed today, followed by a turn toward the north tonight, and a turn toward the northeast on Saturday. The center of the storm will continue moving near the northwestern Bahamas this morning and move north of the Bahamas tonight.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Hurricane force winds extend outward up to 35 miles from the center, with tropical storm force winds extending up to 275 miles. Sandy\xE2\x80\x99s wind field is expected to grow in size during the next couple of days.</p>\n\

    <p>The case against <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpatch.com%2fA-yQsZ\">pipe bomb suspect David A. Dougherty</a> only seems to be getting stronger as\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fcuyahogafalls.patch.com%2flistings%2fcuyahoga-falls-police-department\">Cuyahoga Falls Police</a>\xC2\xA0hit him\xC2\xA0with additional felony counts and charges this week.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Dougherty, 49, of Cuyahoga Falls, now faces two counts of possession of criminal tools, trafficking in drugs, weapons while under disability and three counts of possession of dangerous ordnance (explosives), according to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.stowmunicourt.com%2f\">stowmunicourt.com.</a></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>He is also charged with illegal manufacturing of drugs, a fourth-degree misdemeanor; after police found a suspected marijuana grow operation in his residence.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>On Tuesday, Dougherty pled not guilty to the marijuana charge during an arraignment at Stow Municipal Court.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Regarding the felonies, Dougherty will be prosecuted either in Summit County Common Pleas Court; or, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in conjunction with the U.S. Attorney\xE2\x80\x99s Office may step in and prosecute, according to Falls Police Chief Tom Pozza.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>If the latter occurs, Dougherty\xE2\x80\x99s charges would be dismissed and federal charges -- which typically carry harsher penalties and sentences -- would be brought against him <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ohnd.uscourts.gov%2fcontact-us%2f\">in Akron\xE2\x80\x99s John F. Seiberling Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse</a>, said Pozza.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Due to the ongoing investigation, Pozza wouldn't comment on whether Dougherty had confessed to making the bombs or how he intended to use them.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>Pipe bombs found</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>On Oct. 20 at 2:30 p.m., Cuyahoga Falls Fire and EMS requested backup when Dougherty resisted paramedics that had entered his home to treat him for a medical emergency.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>As\xC2\xA0Cuyahoga Falls Police arrived, paramedics said they had found what appeared to be pipe bombs in Dougherty\xE2\x80\x99s home, located at 1116 Washington Avenue, according to Falls Police Lt. Steve Guldeman.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Summit County sheriffs, the Summit County Bomb Squad and ATF agents responded to the scene and cordoned off the area.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Once the bomb squad removed the makeshift explosives, \xE2\x80\x9C(Cuyahoga Falls) patrol officers and detectives executed a search warrant at the residence.

                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; New Hampshire health officials hoping to learn from the kind of drug diversion debacle facing Exeter Hospital got some detailed advice Thursday from out-of-state hospitals that have weathered similar incidents.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The New Hampshire Hospital Association invited officials from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and Rose Medical Center in Denver, Colo., to share how they responded to drug diversion problems at their facilities.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In Minnesota, a nurse at a Mayo hospital in Mankato was accused in 2008 of stealing the powerful painkiller fentanyl and replacing it with syringes of saline solution, depriving surgical patients of their medication. In Denver, a former surgical technician is serving a 30-year sentence after pleading guilty in 2009 to similar allegations. Kristen Diane Parker, who got another job at a second Colorado hospital less than two weeks after being fired from Rose Medical Center, was also accused of infecting up to three dozen patients with hepatitis C through her drug diversion.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The Colorado case bears some similarity to the case of David Kwiatkowski, a former cardiac catheterization lab worker who is accused of stealing drugs from Exeter Hospital and replacing them with tainted syringes that were later used on patients. Thirty-two people have been diagnosed with the same strain of hepatitis C he carries since the investigation began in May.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Kevin Dillon, director of pharmacy services at the Mayo Clinic, said responding to such incidents requires a consistent, managed approach. Mayo now has a medical diversion prevention coordinator position as well as an eight-member team that meets within 24 hours of hearing about a suspected drug diversion case.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t react to each one of these as if they&rsquo;re a new thing,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>After the 2008 incident, Dillon said Mayo performed a detailed analysis to identify risk points &mdash; medication being left unattended, for example &mdash; and came up with more than 100 changes it could make. It also developed a list of 77 core structures and processes that it is working to implement in all its facilities. Even when that is done, drug diversion will still occur, he said, but the changes will make it harder.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;When it comes to diverters, &lsquo;They&rsquo;re smart, we&rsquo;re smart, they&rsquo;re desperate, we&rsquo;re not,'&rsquo;&rsquo; he said, quoting a colleague. &lsquo;&lsquo;So eventually we hope they slip up and we do catch them.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>David Theil, an anesthesiologist at Rose Medical Center, said before the 2009 incident there, anesthesiologists frequently filled syringes for multiple patients to be better prepared before procedures.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;You were looked at poorly if you waited until the patient came in the room,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>It was an uphill battle to get those workers to accept changes made after the incident to ensure that medication wasn&rsquo;t withdrawn from dispensing machines until right before a procedure, he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In addition to strengthening its hiring procedures and making other changes, the hospital also has tried to enact broader cultural changes, said Robert Campbell, vice president of operations. Every staff meeting starts with a &lsquo;&lsquo;safety moment&rsquo;&rsquo; to discuss ways to improve patient safety, he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>After the 2009 incident, &lsquo;&lsquo;There were many feelings of guilt, of how could this have happened? How could I have allowed this vulnerability and how could I have potentially hurt somebody?&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;&lsquo;Quickly, we really had to get over that and say, it&rsquo;s really not about me, it&rsquo;s about the patients.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Since Kwiatkowski&rsquo;s arrest in July, Exeter Hospital has been hit with numerous lawsuits and the prospect of losing its Medicare funding if it doesn&rsquo;t fix problems uncovered during a federal inspection trigged by the outbreak of hepatitis C, a blood-borne viral infection that can cause liver disease and chronic health issues. It also has been wrangling with state public health officials over whether it has to release detailed medical records the state is seeking as part of its investigation.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="">
    <p>Kwiatkowski has pleaded not guilty to stealing drugs and tampering with needles.<img alt="end of story marker" border="0" height="8" width="6" src="http://www.boston.com/r/SysConfig/WebPortal/Boston/Framework/images/site_graphics/dingbat_story_end_icon.gif" class="storyend"></p>

    					<p class="byline"><p class="byline">By Sarah N. Mattero and Martin Finucane, Globe Correspondent Globe Staff</p></p>
    					<p>A small plane crashed this afternoon on Interstate 93 in Hooksett, N.H., killing two people, New Hampshire State Police said.</p>
    <p>The Beechcraft Bonanza with two on board crashed between Exits 10 and 11. It was registered to a Rhode Island architectural firm. The Federal Aviation Administration was headed to the scene, the FAA said in a statement.</p>
    <p>New Hampshire Department of Transportation spokesman Bill Boynton said that reports of the crash were received at about 1:15 p.m. The crash happened just south of the I-93/I-293 split, at mile marker 26.2, he said. </p>
    <p>The plane, which had left Nashua, N.H., and was en route to Laconia, N.H., came to rest next to a guardrail after it struck a light pole adjacent to the highway which caused the plane to nose dive, a preliminary investigation found, State Police said. </p>
    <p>A man and a woman were in the plane; their names were not immediately released. State Police said the man was ejected from the aircraft.</p>
    <p>A Globe employee who was driving up I-93 North saw the wreckage at about 1:10 p.m. She said she saw a small plane on the left side of the road.</p>
    <p>The tail of the plane was in the road. The section of the road at that point has three lanes. There was no fire and no smoke, Barbara Gibson said. Emergency vehicles raced past, on the way to the plane. </p>
    <p>Before emergency vehicles arrived, Gibson said she saw two men in suits standing by the plane, including one who looked like New Hampshire Governor John Lynch. His press secretary, Colin Manning, later confirmed that Lynch had been returning from a funeral in Salem, saw the wreck, and waited there until help arrived. </p>
    <p>State Police said the ramp from I-93 North to I-293 South was closed and two of the I-93 North lanes were closed.</p>
    <p>Boynton said drivers should expect traffic delays throughout the afternoon and suggested that people seek alternate routes.</p>
    <p>The incident is under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board, FAA, and the state Bureau of Aeronautics.</p>

    <p>All of us\xE2\x80\x94adults, teens and children\xE2\x80\x94enjoy a scary chill.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>And what better time of year than Halloween\xC2\xA0to indulge in stories that make our spines tingle?\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>It's the perfect time\xC2\xA0for your family to share some spooky stories each evening. To get you started, here are some Halloween books filled with ghosts and ghouls, wizards and witches, haunted houses and black magic that everyone can enjoy together.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    &#13;\n\
    </p><p>Children ages 2-6 love the fun of Halloween: costumes, trick-or-treating and gentle tales of ghosts and goblins. Here are some books for this age group:</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ul><li><strong>\"Ghosts in the House\" by\xC2\xA0Kazuno Kohara\xE2\x80\x94</strong>There are fuzzy pumpkin costumes in sizes as small as 6 months, so why not a Halloween board book for toddlers? This one tells the tale of a little girl who moves into a new house only to discover it is haunted.\xC2\xA0No worries.\xC2\xA0Turns out she\xE2\x80\x99s a witch, and she knows exactly what to do. In a twist on the sheet-as-ghost costume, our little witch gathers the pesky ghosts, puts them in the washing machine, hangs them on the line, and makes bed sheets out of them.\xC2\xA0Stylishly illustrated in orange and black, this story has just right balance for very young children. (Ages 1-6)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>\"Go Away, Big Green Monster!\" by\xC2\xA0Ed Emberley</strong>\xE2\x80\x94This big-faced monster has two yellow eyes, a long blue nose, sharp white teeth, two little squiggly ears, scraggly purple hair and a scary green face. (Ages 3-6)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>\"The Little Old Lady Who Was Not Afraid of Anything\" by Linda Williams; Illustrated by Megan Lloyd</strong>\xE2\x80\x94In this cumulative story that will have everyone chiming in on the telling, we watch an unflappable little old lady encounter two clomping shoes, a wiggling pair of pants, a shaking shirt, two clapping gloves, a nodding hat and one scary pumpkin head that says, \xE2\x80\x9CBOO, BOO!\xE2\x80\x9D (Ages 3-7)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>\"The Monster Returns\" by\xC2\xA0Peter McCarty</strong>\xE2\x80\x94When the phone rings and Jeremy\xE2\x80\x99s blue monster announces that he is bored and coming back, Jeremy invites his friends over to draw their own monsters. Then, when Jeremy\xE2\x80\x99s monster arrives, he is greeted by a roomful of friends. And friends are just what the monster\xC2\xA0and<i>\xC2\xA0</i>Jeremy need! (Ages 3-7)</li>&#13;\n\
    </ul><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><ul><li><strong>\"Night of the Pumpkinheads\" by\xC2\xA0Michael J. Rosen; illustrated by Hugh McMahon</strong>\xE2\x80\x94All those pumpkins sitting on the porch want their turn to put on costumes and go trick-or-treating.\xC2\xA0And this year, they have their chance!

(Ages 6-9)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>\"Earwig and the Witch\" by\xC2\xA0Diana Wynne Jones; Illustrated by Paul O. Zelinsky</strong>\xE2\x80\x94Earwig was left in a basket on the doorstep of St. Morwald\xE2\x80\x99s Home for Children with a note suggesting she had been left there by a witch. Earwig is happy at St. Morwald\xE2\x80\x99s. Why not?\xC2\xA0 She uses her \xE2\x80\x9Cstrange abilities\xE2\x80\x9D to get whatever she wants\xE2\x80\x94from her favorite lunch to a new red sweater\xE2\x80\x94until she meets her matches in Bella Yaga and the Mandrake, who adopt her.\xC2\xA0 Her new home is strange to be sure: rooms change boundaries, smells and sights appear and disappear, and Thomas, the black cat, can talk. But Earwig is determined to take control, and she and Thomas begin to work some magic of their own. (Ages 7-10)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>\"Dragonbreath: Curse of the Were-Wiener\" and\xC2\xA0other books in the Dragonbreath series\xC2\xA0by Ursula Vernon</strong>\xE2\x80\x94Just as Danny\xE2\x80\x99s best friend Wendell the Iguana is about to bite into a hot dog, the hot dog bites back!

    <p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Good morning and welcome to Thursday! Another beautiful fall week is coming to a close; I hope you\xE2\x80\x99ve been getting out and enjoying the mild temperatures and colorful leaves \xE2\x80\x93 though not as colorful as I would like, I have to say. Does it seem a little duller to you this year? It does to me.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>One thing I love about the fall is the start of the theater season, and we\xE2\x80\x99re lucky to be swimming in it here in town. For starters, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.concordplayers.org\">The Concord Players</a> open their season with a Tony-award-winner, . This was also a movie starring Henry Fonda, James Cagney and William Powell, among others. All the action takes place aboard a cargo vessel in the South Pacific during WWII. The set alone is reason enough to see this show: Carlisle resident Allen Bantly has designed and built an amazing replica of a ship. One side shows the deck, and when it miraculously turns on a turntable built onto the stage, you\xE2\x80\x99re in one of the bunkrooms. It\xE2\x80\x99s an engineering feat.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The play is based on a book of short stories by real-life sailor Thomas Heggen, describing his exploits on the USS Virgo in the 1940s. It\xE2\x80\x99s a group of bored and randy sailors longing for shore leave, their tyrannical captain and the one man, Mister Roberts, who risks it all to make it possible. It\xE2\x80\x99s hilarious, and the cast includes a number of guys who have graced this stage before: Gordie Ellis, John Alzapiedi Craig Howard, Jay Newlon and Chuck Holleman, among others.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>At $20 a ticket, this is the best bang for your buck you can get for live theater, and if you really want to have a total night out, come opening night, when they serve appetizers and drinks. It\xE2\x80\x99s a whole lot of fun, I\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you. I plan to be there!</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The show opens next Friday, Nov. 2, at 8 p.m., and runs for three weekends, through Nov. 17. For all the good details, including how and where to order your tickets, go to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.concordplayers.org\">www.concordplayers.org</a> and click on Tickets. And go support our local theater!</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b><i>Let\xE2\x80\x99s Do the Time Warp Again!<br></i></b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Halloween is coming up fast and furious, that night when ghosts, goblins and Lady Gaga roam the streets demanding free candy. And what better way to celebrate than with a showing of <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.facebook.com%2frockyhorrorshow\">Richard O\xE2\x80\x99Brien\xE2\x80\x99s Rocky Horror Show</a>. Yes, I discovered that this is playing on stage over at <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.emersonumbrella.org%2f\">Emerson Umbrella</a> \xE2\x80\x93 to my horror, I had no idea they staged theatrical productions of this nature over at our venerable art studio.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>And yes, it\xE2\x80\x99s theater, not the movie, so live people will be performing this cult classic.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>For those of you not in the know, this wacky musical tells the story on an engaged couple who get caught in a storm and find themselves at the home of a mad transvestite scientist getting ready to unveil his new creation, a muscle man named Rocky Horror.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A number of the cast were part of the production in 2010, for which the Umbrella won a DASH award, meaning they are very talented and won\xE2\x80\x99t disappoint. The show opens tomorrow night, Oct. 26, at 8 p.m., and runs through Nov. 3 \xE2\x80\x93 Saturdays will have two shows, at 7 and 10 p.m. There will even be special Halloween performances on Tuesday and Wednesday, Oct. 30 and 31, at 8 p.m. Sounds like a rollicking good time! For all the good info on tickets and such, click <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.emersonumbrella.org%2ftheater%2f2012-fall-productions%2f\">here</a>; if you already know you want to buy tickets, click <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ticketstage.com%2fbin%2ff.wk%3fts.admin.homepage.gen%2b%40THEATER%3dEUCA\">here</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>This Saturday, Oct. 27 <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fsaveourheritage.com%2f\">Save Our Heritage</a> and <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2flistings%2fminute-man-national-historical-park\">Minute Man National Historical Park</a> are holding an event to celebrate the completion of the Save Our Heritage restoration of Barrett Farm, and the transfer of its ownership to the National Park Service, Minute Man National Historical Park.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A public ceremony with U.S. Rep Niki Tsongas and others will take place at Barrett Farm, 448 Barretts Mill Road, at 11 a.m., followed by an Open House from noon to 4 p.m.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Restoration of the historic Barrett House, built in 1705, began eight years ago when Save Our Heritage (SOH), a Concord-based nonprofit preservation organization, acquired Barrett Farm and the 3.4 acres of surrounding land from the McGrath family.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CIt was a collaborative effort right from the start between Save Our Heritage, the Town, the Park, and the McGraths,\xE2\x80\x9D said Neil Rasmussen, president of SOH.\xC2\xA0 \xE2\x80\x9COur shared goal was to have Save Our Heritage restore the Col. James Barrett House to the way it was during Revolutionary times, and to eventually incorporate it into Minute Man Park so that visitors could experience it as living history. And that time has finally come.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Col. James Barrett Farm is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as one of the most important Revolutionary War landmarks of national significance. Col. James Barrett, a member of the Provincial Congress, was the senior officer and overall field commander at the North Bridge in the first battle of the American Revolution. He was also in charge of all the supplies in the area, enough for an army of 15,000. When the British Regulars marched to Concord on April 19, 1775, they were intent on seizing weapons and other military supplies stored throughout the town, including a major stockpile on Colonel Barrett\xE2\x80\x99s property.\xC2\xA0The farm and the Barrett family provide a central link to the story of \xE2\x80\x9Cthe shot heard \xE2\x80\x98round the world.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Barrett property has been farmed continuously from Colonial times to the present, and has been owned by only two families over the past 300 years -- the Barretts for 200 of those years, and the McGraths for 100. Michael McGrath now resides in a house behind the Col. James Barrett house, and his late brother Patrick farmed the surrounding land and ran the McGrath Farmstand across the road.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Since 2004, the exterior restoration of Barrett House has seen the stabilization of the back wall; completion of a new wood roof; application of hand-skived pine clapboards; and the installation of handmade replications of the original 1770\xE2\x80\x99s doors and faithful reproductions of the original window frames and sash.\xC2\xA0In addition, archaeological studies were conducted, and the land behind the house was cleared to reveal a more open agrarian landscape. Painstaking restoration and preservation of the interior of the house has included stabilizing of original plaster walls; repointing of fireboxes; and the restoration of wood paneling and floors.\xC2\xA0In addition, careful paint conservation techniques have revealed many original and exceedingly rare colonial paint surfaces.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CMuch of our restoration work employed methods and materials used in the 18th century, wherever possible,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jim Cunningham, the project manager forSOH-Barrett Farm.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The wood used to stabilize the post and beam structure was hand-hewn by traditional timber framers, and wrought iron reproduction hardware was fashioned by Concord\xE2\x80\x99s local blacksmith, Carl Close. As a result of this meticulous attention to details, when visitors enter the house, they are transported to Revolutionary times and can sense a direct, living, tangible link to the beginning of our nation.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>This eight-year restoration project was generously funded by four CPA grants from the town of Concord, a Save America\xE2\x80\x99s Treasures grant from the Department of the Interior, and numerous private donations. Many town departments and committees have provided critical assistance and dozens of volunteers and organizations, including the Boy Scouts, have donated their time and effort to the project.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CRestoring Barrett Farm was only one part of the preservation effort. Getting it incorporated into Minute Man National Historical Park was the other part, and this involved a three-part process at the federal level spanning several years,\xE2\x80\x9D said Anna West Winter, executive director of SOH. \xE2\x80\x9CIn 2005, the late Senator Edward Kennedy and former Representative Marty Meehan lent their energetic support to sponsoring legislation to facilitate a feasibility study of the farm's inclusion in the Park.\xC2\xA0 Later,\xE2\x80\x9D Winter adds, \xE2\x80\x9Cin 2009, thanks to the steadfast leadership of Congresswoman Niki Tsongas, Minute Man Park\xE2\x80\x99s boundaries were expanded by Congressional legislation to include the Col. James Barrett House and additional surrounding acres.\xE2\x80\x9D\xC2\xA0Finally, this year Congress appropriated the funds needed for the National Park Service to acquire Barrett House and the surrounding land.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CWe\xE2\x80\x99re delighted to finally have the Col. James Barrett House incorporated into Minute Man National Historical Park,\xE2\x80\x9D stated the Park\xE2\x80\x99s Supertintendent, Nancy Nelson.\xC2\xA0 \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s something we have been looking forward to for a long time. Barrett Farm completes the narrative of the beginning of the American Revolution within the Park.\xE2\x80\x9D\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Barrett Farm Celebration on October 27 at 11:00 a.m. will be held outside on the lawn, rain or shine at 448 Barretts Mill Road.\xC2\xA0</p>\n\

                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; New Hampshire health officials hoping to learn from the kind of drug diversion debacle facing Exeter Hospital got some detailed advice Thursday from out-of-state hospitals that have weathered similar incidents.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The New Hampshire Hospital Association invited officials from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and Rose Medical Center in Denver, Colo., to share how they responded to drug diversion problems at their facilities.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In Minnesota, a nurse at a Mayo hospital in Mankato was accused in 2008 of stealing the powerful painkiller fentanyl and replacing it with syringes of saline solution, depriving surgical patients of their medication. In Denver, a former surgical technician is serving a 30-year sentence after pleading guilty in 2009 to similar allegations. Kristen Diane Parker, who got another job at a second Colorado hospital less than two weeks after being fired from Rose Medical Center, was also accused of infecting up to three dozen patients with hepatitis C through her drug diversion.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The Colorado case bears some similarity to the case of David Kwiatkowski, a former cardiac catheterization lab worker who is accused of stealing drugs from Exeter Hospital and replacing them with tainted syringes that were later used on patients. Thirty-two people have been diagnosed with the same strain of hepatitis C he carries since the investigation began in May.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Kevin Dillon, director of pharmacy services at the Mayo Clinic, said responding to such incidents requires a consistent, managed approach. Mayo now has a medical diversion prevention coordinator position as well as an eight-member team that meets within 24 hours of hearing about a suspected drug diversion case.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t react to each one of these as if they&rsquo;re a new thing,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>After the 2008 incident, Dillon said Mayo performed a detailed analysis to identify risk points &mdash; medication being left unattended, for example &mdash; and came up with more than 100 changes it could make. It also developed a list of 77 core structures and processes that it is working to implement in all its facilities. Even when that is done, drug diversion will still occur, he said, but the changes will make it harder.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;When it comes to diverters, &lsquo;They&rsquo;re smart, we&rsquo;re smart, they&rsquo;re desperate, we&rsquo;re not,'&rsquo;&rsquo; he said, quoting a colleague. &lsquo;&lsquo;So eventually we hope they slip up and we do catch them.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>David Theil, an anesthesiologist at Rose Medical Center, said before the 2009 incident there, anesthesiologists frequently filled syringes for multiple patients to be better prepared before procedures.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;You were looked at poorly if you waited until the patient came in the room,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>It was an uphill battle to get those workers to accept changes made after the incident to ensure that medication wasn&rsquo;t withdrawn from dispensing machines until right before a procedure, he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In addition to strengthening its hiring procedures and making other changes, the hospital also has tried to enact broader cultural changes, said Robert Campbell, vice president of operations. Every staff meeting starts with a &lsquo;&lsquo;safety moment&rsquo;&rsquo; to discuss ways to improve patient safety, he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>After the 2009 incident, &lsquo;&lsquo;There were many feelings of guilt, of how could this have happened? How could I have allowed this vulnerability and how could I have potentially hurt somebody?&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;&lsquo;Quickly, we really had to get over that and say, it&rsquo;s really not about me, it&rsquo;s about the patients.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Since Kwiatkowski&rsquo;s arrest in July, Exeter Hospital has been hit with numerous lawsuits and the prospect of losing its Medicare funding if it doesn&rsquo;t fix problems uncovered during a federal inspection trigged by the outbreak of hepatitis C, a blood-borne viral infection that can cause liver disease and chronic health issues. It also has been wrangling with state public health officials over whether it has to release detailed medical records the state is seeking as part of its investigation.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="">
    <p>Kwiatkowski has pleaded not guilty to stealing drugs and tampering with needles.<img alt="end of story marker" border="0" height="8" width="6" src="http://www.boston.com/r/SysConfig/WebPortal/Boston/Framework/images/site_graphics/dingbat_story_end_icon.gif" class="storyend"></p>

    <p>The evening was cold and rainy and the local high school football team was playing its neighboring rival. But the Republican presidential ticket of Romney and Ryan drew a huge crowd to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fnorthcanton.patch.com%2flistings%2fhoover-high-school\">Hoover High School</a> Friday night.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Gov. Mitt Romney campaigned in\xC2\xA0Iowa\xC2\xA0and\xC2\xA0Ohio Friday\xC2\xA0as national polls showed a tightening presidential race. <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpoliticalticker.blogs.cnn.com%2f2012%2f10%2f26%2fcnn-poll-obama-50-romney-46-in-ohio%2f\">A CNN poll on Friday showed</a> Obama leading by 4 percentage points in Ohio.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>With the race seeming to be narrowing here, rally-goers at Hoover High School said on Friday that this presidential contest was getting exciting and very watchable.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"I think this is the most excited I've seen people ever,\" said Lauren Zink of Jackson Township. \"It's good. I think it should continue like this. I\xC2\xA0think this is probably the biggest election we've had since ... I've been voting.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Megan Murphy of Canton said with the race so close, the election takes on even more significance. She was glad to attend Friday's rally -- even if the weather was miserable.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"It's so close and so historic,\" Murphy said. \"I don't think it's smart to miss anything like this.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Romney came onstage at about 8:15 p.m. and started off by attacking Obama's health care reform plan.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Romney told the crowd that\xC2\xA0the president has chosen to make election about Sesame Street characters and word games.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"The Obama\xC2\xA0campaign is out of ideas and out of excuses,\" Romney said. \"That's why, come November, you're going to make sure he's out of office.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Romney said that while he has no plans to cut the military, Obama will.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Romney also said he will \"get economy going\" by taking advantage of energy resources and opening new trade with other nations.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"I'll lower tax rates on small businesses,\" Romney said. \"Unlike the current administration, I like business because I like the jobs that business creates.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>His running mate, Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan, came on stage with his wife and children.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"We need leadership. We need a leader to run at these problems and fix these problems in Washington,\" Ryan said. \"And that is Mitt Romney.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Ryan said the presdient is \"dividing, trying to win an election by default.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Think about how we would feel if Obama were elected,\" Ryan said. \"We would have another four years like the last four years.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Several speakers took the stage to whip up the crowd before the GOP main event.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Patricia Heaton, Cleveland-area native and star of the television show \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" introduced Romney and Ryan.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"You know what Cleveland's motto is? At least we're not Akron,\" Heaton told the crowd. \"But after driving through your beautiful city it should be 'We wish we were Canton.'</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"We have the opportunity to vote for someone who, as governor, brought both parties together and turned a deficit into a surplus,\" Heaton said of Romney before introducing Ryan.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, running for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Sherrod Brown, said, \"The only way we're going to change Washington is by changing the people we send there.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci, also up for elections in District 16, gots boos while talking about Brown and cheers when mentioning Mandel.\xC2\xA0U.S. Rep. Bob Gibbs, who is seeking election to District 18, predicted that the president will get the pink slip in 11 days.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Friday's rally, which was attended by thousands, was the second or third GOP political appearance that Bruce Hein and his wife have attended in recent weeks.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Canton couple said they both planned to vote for the Romney ticket.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Marge Hein said the country needs a president with good business sense. \"Obama's not doing anything,\" she said.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Economy policy and the federal budget also was influencing Zink's vote. \"We cannot be in debt by trillions of dollars,\" she said. \"A new direction is what we need.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Rally-goers began to fill the high school baseball field around 5 p.m. as dusk fell on the chilly, rainy day. The line to enter the event wrapped around the entire baseball field and down an adjoining side street.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A stage was set up in the middle of the Hoover High School baseball field, faced by the stadium seats. The Oak Ridge Boys performed before the speakers got under way.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The event came on an evening with another must-watch contest that captured the attention of North Canton residents. But this battle played out on a football field: the Hoover High Vikings were set to play their neighboring rivals, the Jackson Polar Bears.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p>\n\

    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; A registered nurse who police say told them she killed her brother-in-law with medication she took home by mistake has had her license suspended by the state Board of Nursing.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Catherine George went to police in Derry on Oct. 14 and said she had killed her 55-year-old brother-in-law, Randall Percival, by giving him 300 units of insulin, the state attorney general&rsquo;s office says.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>George gave police a large syringe and a glass vial of insulin and told them Percival &lsquo;&lsquo;didn&rsquo;t need to suffer anymore,&rsquo;&rsquo; the nursing board said Wednesday in an email.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>George, when asked how she got the insulin, said she took it home from work by mistake in July and forgot to return it, the nursing board said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Percival, who lived in Raymond, died Oct. 9. Police couldn&rsquo;t comment on how Percival might have been suffering or on anything else, and they referred questions to the attorney general&rsquo;s office.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>A criminal investigation into Percival&rsquo;s death is ongoing, and the nursing board said it was unknown what, if any, charges might be filed.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The nursing board issued an emergency suspension of George&rsquo;s license on Tuesday, saying it had received information indicating her continued practice of nursing posed &lsquo;&lsquo;an imminent threat to public health, safety and/or welfare.&rsquo;&rsquo; It scheduled a hearing for Nov. 2 to determine if the suspension should continue or if permanent disciplinary sanctions should be imposed.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="">
    <p>George, who was first granted her nursing license in 1994, couldn&rsquo;t be reached for comment on Wednesday.

                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>EXETER, N.H. (AP) &mdash; New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called on New Hampshire voters to support fellow Republican Ovide LaMontagne in the race for governor and described challenger Maggie Hassan as a &lsquo;&lsquo;New Jersey Democrat.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The famously outspoken Christie was the headliner for a night of stump speeches in front of a standing-room only crowd of about 300 at the Old Town Hall on Wednesday.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Former Republican governors of New Hampshire, John Sununu, Craig Benson, and Stephen Merrill, delivered brief opening remarks, and all reminded the crowd that the race for president and governor are very close and only 13 days remained to convince undecided voters.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>LaMontagne fired up the crowd by criticizing Hassan&rsquo;s tax policies and accused her of trying to get voters to take their &lsquo;&lsquo;eyes off the ball.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>He implored the audience to tell their friends, families, and co-workers what the race is all about.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;This race is about jobs, the economy, and lowering taxes,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Introducing Christie, La Montagne said &lsquo;&lsquo;The states that are doing the best right now are the ones that are led by Republican governors.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Christie, the first-term New Jersey governor, had spent the day in Massachusetts campaigning for U.S. Sen. Scott Brown. He brought the crowd to its feet as soon as he entered the hall.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;New Jersey has lived the horror film that your lives will become if you elect Maggie Hassan,&rsquo;&rsquo; Christie said. &lsquo;&lsquo;She&rsquo;s a New Jersey Democrat.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Christie criticized Hassan&rsquo;s opposition of an amendment to the state constitution to ban income tax.  He then described how, in 1976, New Jersey instituted a state income tax of 2 percent.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Today, it is 9 percent and New Jersey has the third highest income tax in the country,&rsquo;&rsquo; Christie said. &lsquo;&lsquo;Ovide will make sure, with every ounce of energy he has, that that will not happen in New Hampshire.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Christie had the crowd laughing a number of times, but also delivered a long and impassioned plea for support.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Echoing previous speakers, he reminded the audience that less than two weeks remained to get the Republican message out before the election.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;New Hampshire doesn&rsquo;t want to be known as another failed liberal experiment,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;&lsquo;When people say that politicians are all the same, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter who you vote for, that&rsquo;s the lazy, easy, response. Governors matter. They become the spiritual leaders of the state.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>As an example, Christie recalled polls from just before he took office that showed 19 percent of his constituents approved of the direction New Jersey was going.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Today, it&rsquo;s 54 percent,&rsquo;&rsquo; the governor said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s more than just a vote. You are part of a movement to change history in New Hampshire.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Earlier Wednesday, the president of the national Planned Parenthood Action Fund called Hassan a champion for women&rsquo;s right to make their own health decisions.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Cecile Richards told reporters at a news conference Wednesday the stakes for women are high in this election.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Hassan was asked about a comment made by Indiana Senate candidate Richard Mourdock, who said that when a woman becomes pregnant during a rape, &lsquo;&lsquo;that&rsquo;s something God intended.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Hassan said a group of candidates are running for office who believe women can&rsquo;t be trusted to make their own health care decisions. Hassan argues rival Lamontagne is too extreme because he supports limiting abortion and employer paid coverage of contraceptives.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="">

    <p>The Massachusetts School Building Authority will reinstate funding for the troubled Concord-Carlisle High School building project, state Representative Cory Atkins announced Wednesday. The state suspended $28.8 million worth of grant payments for the district&rsquo;s $92.6 million high school project in June, saying that the project had ballooned over budget and scope. At one point this past spring, the project was poised to run between $15 million and $17 million over its construction budget. Costs have since been reined in, and the project is back on track, according to school officials.

    </p><p>The  restored funding comes with stipulations that the MSBA will formally  present in a letter to the district in the next couple of weeks. Many  of the  stipulations focus on the problems caused by miscommunication. The  district will now be required to have a clear communication plan and to  submit monthly progress reports to the MSBA that will be assessable to  the public.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Representative  Atkins is delighted that funding will be restored and that the project  will move forward. \xE2\x80\x9CIt was extremely helpful to me during the  negotiations  that this project has almost universal support in my communities,\xE2\x80\x9D said  Atkins.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Conflict  in Concord arose when members of the community questioned whether they  would get the school they voted for.\xC2\xA0 From now on, any and all  modifications  will be clearly communicated to the public after being approved by the  MSBA.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>The group will meet monthly to discuss pending legislation and other issues of interest. The purpose of this group will be to ensure that, if Michael Benn wins the election on Nov. 6, Democrats will have a seat at the table.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CAs the election gets closer, I am finding that a lot of lifelong Democrats are receptive to my candidacy and willing to support me,\" said Benn. \"I always believed that my common-sense message of fiscal responsibility, balance, and bi-partisanship would have crossover appeal to Independents and Democrats, but I am still amazed by the vast support that I am getting from Democrats who are ready to put party aside and vote for a new vision for the district and the Commonwealth.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Because of the broad, bi-partisan support Benn is receiving, there is a high probability that he will win the State Representative seat in November. He came up with the idea of forming this advisory panel because he realizes that his victory would only be possible with the common support of Republicans, Independents, and Democrats.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Benn is committed to representing everyone in the district,this means carefully considering both sides of every issue.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CI am a principled common-sense conservative, and have been able to find common-ground with many long-time Democrats in the area,\" he said. \"While there are areas of politics where we may disagree, it is clear that we can work together to solve our current fiscal crisis and bring in a new era of bi-partisanship.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Michael Benn is a candidate for State Representative of Massachusetts Fourteenth Middlesex District which includes the towns of Concord, Carlisle, Acton (precincts 1, 2, and 6), and Chelmsford (precincts 1 and 9). He is a lifelong resident of Concord with a BS from Northeastern University, and an MBA from Boston University. He has worked in the private sector, in the field of healthcare finance for the past 24 years.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Benn is running for this seat because his real-world problem-solving experience is needed on Beacon Hill now, more than ever. He will approach every problem from the perspective of the taxpayer, businessperson, student, and parent, not as a government bureaucrat. Benn has the skills necessary to be an exceptional Legislator, one of whom we can be proud.</p></div></div>"

There are \xC2\xA0research studies open for almost any kind of cancer at any given time.\xC2\xA0 If a study is not available for a particular patient, the Cancer Research Program will investigate finding one for the patient.\xC2\xA0 All of the cancer research studies conducted at Summa Health System are Medicare approved clinical trials and therefore, covered by Medicare and other insurance providers.</p>\n\
    <p><a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.summahealthcare1.org%2fwomenshealth%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f10%2f120210148.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2709\" title=\"120210148\" src=\"http://www.summahealthcare1.org/womenshealth/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/120210148.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\"></a></p>\n\
    <p>When a patient enrolls in a clinical trial physicians, researchers and staff follow their treatment closely.\xC2\xA0 Each patient has a clinical research nurse who coordinates their care according to the research study.\xC2\xA0 The research nurse documents any side effects and response to the treatment.\xC2\xA0 Data is collected about the patient\xE2\x80\x99s treatment and the data is entered into an electronic database or data form for submission to the study sponsor.\xC2\xA0The data submitted does not include information that specifically identifies the patient. The physicians at Summa who are treating patients on a clinical trial are updated on a regular basis about the research study and its outcomes.</p>\n\
    <p>Clinical trials for cancer therapies typically assign research participants to receive either the standard therapy currently available or standard therapy plus an experimental product or intervention. \xC2\xA0Participating in a research study typically costs the patient the same amount as standard medical care, yet experimental therapies and additional tests, if needed, are paid for by the sponsor. Discuss with your physician if a clinical trial is right for you, or your loved ones.

    </p><blockquote>&#13;\n\
    <p>As a piece of energy rotates in around that buckling jet stream, just at  the right time across the eastern U.S., Sandy may actually phase with  that upper-level energy and move back toward the coast.\xC2\xA0As this occurs,  Sandy, turns into more of a massive Nor\xE2\x80\x99easter, provides an expanding  wind and rain field that produces damaging gusts, flooding rains and  coastal flooding over parts of the mid-Atlantic and/or New England  anywhere in the Monday-Tuesday timeframe.\xC2\xA0This scenario is now more  likely, and over the next few days, we will be ironing out the details.  Although, the timing of all these ingredients coming together has to be  precise, so there is still a chance of a miss to the east, but that  chance has lowered.</p>&#13;\n\
    </blockquote><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The scenario mentioned above, Lambert continues, would mean winds in the 50-60mph range, with hurricane force (74mph-plus) gusts at the coast, beach erosion, both coastal and inland flooding from torrential rain, and widespread power outages due to wind and downed tree branches.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>If Sandy's path shifts into the Mid-Atlantic states or further north into the Maritimes, Lambert reports, the impact in this area would be much less severe.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The exact impact of Sandy remains unknown, but it's not too early to prepare. The Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency offers <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.mass.gov%2feopss%2fhome-sec-emerg-resp%2fplan-prep%2fnatural-hazards%2fhurricanes%2fmema-offers-hurricane-preparedness-tips.html\">these hurricane preparedness tips</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\

  title: Kentucky's freshmen mesh well in scrimmage
  community_id: "30"

    <div><div id="articleFull"><p><span class="articleBegin">L</span>EXINGTON, Ky. &mdash; There were many moments during Wednesday night&rsquo;s Blue-White scrimmage where Kentucky&rsquo;s freshmen justified the lofty expectations placed upon them.</p>
    <p>Archie Goodwin showed some flash while scoring a game-high 32 points. Willie Cauley-Stein was a formidable post presence with 14 points and 12 rebounds.</p>
    <p>Swingman Alex Poythress added 25 points with quickness and athleticism.</p>
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>A sore back slowed highly touted forward Nerlens Noel, but the point was seeing how this foursome played together and with others in their first competitive appearance before the Wildcats faithful. Early returns were encouraging, as they contributed to both teams in a game won by the Blue 89-88.</p>
    <p>However, the bottom line is meeting John Calipari&rsquo;s high standards and the Wildcats coach quickly noted that this is a work in progress.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;We have a way to go,&rdquo; Calipari said afterward. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t rebound, we don&rsquo;t scramble. Other than that, we&rsquo;re a pretty good team.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Calipari was kidding, noting replacing six players from last season&rsquo;s national championship team would lead to some falloff. Kentucky had scrimmaged just 12 minutes before Wednesday because he has spent much of fall practice teaching his young squad fundamentals.</p>
    <p>That showed with a lack of defense.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to take a lot more talking on defense and just executing on the defensive schemes more than we have been,&rdquo; Goodwin said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re still learning, so we&rsquo;ll continue to practice on it. We&rsquo;ll get better and better every day we practice it as long as we work hard.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>At the same time, some nice combinations emerged thanks to newcomers such as transfer Julius Mays, a graduate student who played last season for Wright State.</p>
    <p>He displayed good speed and ball movement along with a nice outside shot for the Blue squad. The highlight of his 13-point game was a fadeaway 3-pointer as the shot clock expired, which looked more planned than hurried.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just trying to find my game,&rdquo; Mays said. &ldquo;I just want to do whatever it is this team needs me to do, whether that&rsquo;s scoring or coming in and creating for others or distributing the ball, or even if it&rsquo;s coming in and getting greedy on the defensive end. I&rsquo;m willing to do whatever it takes to win.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>He seemed to find chemistry with Cauley-Stein, who fed him for one shot before Mays returned the favor by lobbing a pass to the 7-footer for a dunk to help the Blue team lead 29-17.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Me and Julius are (among) seven players that figure to get a lot of playing time, so we had to go at it like that,&rdquo; Cauley-Stein said.</p>
    <p>Noel finished with nine points on 4-of-7 shooting.</p>
    <p>Among the veterans, Kyle Wiltjer had 28 points, Jon Hood 17 and Jarrod Polson 13. Sophomore Ryan Harrow had 20.</p>

    <p>BOSTON (CBS) &#8211; Women in East Boston are on alert once again, after another woman was attacked not far from the Maverick MBTA stop.</p>\n\
    <p>This latest attack happened shortly after one o&#8217;clock Wednesday morning. A woman walking near the intersection of Meridian and Lexington Streets says she was attacked from behind by a man who pushed her to the ground.</p>\n\
    <p>It&#8217;s a scenario very similar to three other attacks in the area in recent weeks.</p>\n\
    <p>In this most recent incident, a Good Samaritan heard the victim scream and ran across the street to help her out.</p>\n\
    <p>The suspect took off on foot towards Border Street. The victim described him to police as a black man in his late twenties, about 5\xE2\x80\x992\xE2\x80\x9D, stocky, and possibly with a birth mark on his left cheek.\n\

    <p>AKRON, Ohio -- A little sunshine is sure to beam down on either Akron or Central Michigan Saturday as one of them will pull out its first league victory of the dwindling football season. </p>
    <p>Akron (1-7, 0-4 Mid-American Conference) goes into the game against the Chippewas (2-5, 0-3) in Mount Pleasant, Mich., looking for its first road win since Oct. 18, 2008, at Eastern Michigan. That was six wins and four years ago, when J.D. Brookhart was the coach. </p>
    <p>Akron coach Terry Bowden's team is battling mounting injuries -- starting tailback Jawon Chisholm is expected to miss the game with wrist and shoulder injuries -- as it looks for its second victory of the season. Even though Chisholm is out and the Zips' passing game is potent, look for Akron to run the football more. CMU has allowed an average of 234.4 yards per game on the ground, with 20 touchdowns. </p>
    <p>Akron hasn't won since defeating Morgan State, 66-6, in the third game of the season. That was during a stretch in which Akron's offense was humming. Since losing to Miami, 59-46, Akron has posted 10, 28 and seven points. The Zips are sixth in the MAC in scoring and total offense, after leading the conference in both categories just three games ago. </p>
    <p>Yet Akron's passing game remains the best in the MAC. The Zips are averaging 311.5 yards per game through the air, and their 23 touchdown passes lead the league. </p>
    <p>Like Akron, CMU has faced the MAC's top teams so far, with defending MAC champion Northern Illinois a common opponent. The Chippewas lost to NIU, 55-24, while the Zips are coming off a 37-7 setback to the Huskies. </p></p>

It lets a network manager monitor the connection quality for end users, bring visibility to connectivity problems so they can be worked out before they affect devices and programs.</p>                                                <div class="medcity-paid-inline">

    											<p>Ketonen explained that with applications like heart monitors, patient records and nurse call systems rely on wireless LAN networks, these connections should be watched more carefully and more proactively. &#8220;Now that cables aren&#8217;t in place anymore and applications have to rely solely on LAN networks, that&#8217;s not an option and (wireless) has to just work,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Measuring and monitoring the network is one thing that you really have to do.&#8221;</p><p>7signal doesn&#8217;t have your typical startup story. The company formed in Finland in 2006 and came to the U.S. only two years ago in an arrangement made through a collaboration between the city of Akron, Ohio and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.akronaccelerator.com%2f">Helsinski Business and Science Park</a> in Finland. Its U.S. headquarters is housed at the Akron Global Business Accelerator.</p><p>Ketonen, a former program manager at Nokia Systems, said that Finland used to be No. 1 in wireless network technology, but has fallen a bit behind. Electronic medical records and wireless networks are being rolled out in hospitals there, but they don&#8217;t have many applications running on them yet. &#8220;In the U.S., all those things are already there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think there is something like a two- to three-year gap between the markets in Finland and U.S.&#8221;</p><p>For the past two years, the company has been working on getting traction in the U.S. and making a name for itself. In 2011, it tested its software solution at Akron General Medical Center and Akron Children&#8217;s Hospital. With some customers, Ketonen said, it has delivered customers a 100 percent to 300 percent improvement in their network&#8217;s performance.</p><p>For now, 7signal is focused on delivering its solution to hospitals and universities, which have hundreds or even thousands of access points for wireless connectivity. &#8220;Medical and hospitals, that&#8217;s the most critical use of wireless LAN you can think of,&#8221; Ketonen said. &#8220;There are lot of devices there, even doctors&#8217; iPads and iPhones.&#8221;</p><p>The healthcare industry spends a reported <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fmedcitynews.com%2f2012%2f06%2freport-healthcare-spends-9-billion-a-year-and-counting-on-staying-connected%2f">$9 billion a year on staying connected</a>, so the company is targeting a huge market. Another thing working in its favor is <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fmedicalconnectivity.com%2f2008%2f05%2f26%2fiec-80001-an-introduction%2f">ISO 80001</a>, a recently established standard that defines the process and requirements for risk management of medical devices and systems on the IT network.</p><p>&#8220;Instead of leaving it there and hoping it works, that will be far from sufficient in the future,&#8221; Ketonen said. &#8220;Proactivity to remove issues is becoming the standard way of working,&#8221;</p>

  content: "<div><div>\n\
    <p>The focus of Breast Cancer Awareness efforts are focused on women -- the ribbons are pink, after all. But men can get breast cancer too.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Patch sat down with a few local experts about male breast cancer:\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ul>&#13;\n\
    &#13;\n\
    </ul><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Patch:</strong>\xC2\xA0Why is it important to talk about male breast cancer?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong>\xC2\xA0It's important because men don't think they can get breast cancer. They don't think they can receive a mammogram screening. The discussion should be focused on breaking the myths and informing people on what is fact versus fiction. Men will say to me \xE2\x80\x9Cmen can't get breast cancer.\xE2\x80\x9D So they tend to show up late, when the lump has been there for several months, which is usually stage 2 or later. And that means that it has already spread to the lymph nodes because they have been waiting. I see this 50 percent of the time. If they never heard of male breast cancer, they think the lump will go away.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Patch:</strong> How common is breast cancer in men?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Dr. Harris:</strong> Male breast cancer is certainly less common, but it is a significant problem. Out of 100 cases 1 will be in men. The lifetime breast cancer risk rate is 1 in 1,000 for men. The average age is between 50-70 years old. So it is not often seen in younger men.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Patch:</strong>\xC2\xA0Is there a stigma related to male breast cancer?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Dr. Lee:\xC2\xA0</strong>Yes. There may be some stigma as it is widely a women's area. If a man goes to a breast center, it is predominantly female. The physician, the technician that takes the mammogram are mostly all women. So men may feel discomfort.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>However, there are groups that are raising awareness among men. Take the NFL for example. The players, wearing pink socks and the pink ribbons this month, are bringing exposure to a venue that men watch. I think this is sparking a discussion for males. They are having conversations with their wives and girlfriends, and asking questions like \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat is this.\xE2\x80\x9D This generation of awareness is the key, as men usually discover breast cancer when it is advanced. So knowing the issue is essential for survival.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Patch: </strong>What are the symptoms for male breast cancer?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Dr. Harris:</strong> Male breast cancer presents almost always as a lump in the breast. Usually there is an enlargement of the breast tissues, although it is not as dramatic as in women. However, there are men who are at higher risk. High risk patients produce more estrogen than normal. It's interesting because the cancerous tissue is almost always estrogen positive.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>We typically see this in the setting of liver disease, alcoholism, obesity and there is a genetic syndrome Klinefelter. In that case a chromosomal abnormality results in an extra \xE2\x80\x9CX\xE2\x80\x9D chromosome. Another symptom could be hypogonadism, which results in impaired testicular function, and leads to a low or non-existent sex drive, or abnormal sexual functioning. In general anything that has affected the liver causing high estrogen, resulting in extremely low testosterone could put a man at risk for breast cancer.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Patch: </strong>When should men be screened for breast cancer or receive a mammogram?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Dr. Harris: </strong>Screening is recommended for men that carry the BReast CAncer gene 2 (BRCA2) or those who have already been found to be in the high risk category. Men should be screened for the BRCA2 gene if their mother, sister or relative was diagnosed with the gene or breast cancer. We recommend genetic testing for the BRCA2 gene if the mother was found to carry it, because it is likely for that person to develop breast cancer. So if a mother finds that she carries this gene than her son should at the very least should be tested for the gene, and if not tested then take a screened mammogram.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong> The question is why is he getting a screening mammogram? He should know something like he is high risk. The men we see in our center definitely have problems when the request a mammogram. So they receive a diagnostic mammogram, which is a more extensive mammogram compared to a screening mammogram.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Patch:</strong> Does family gene tendency matter if you're a man?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong> Yes. You should research your family tree as much possible to see if there is a genetic link. We find that men diagnosed with breast cancer carry the BRAC1 or BRAC2 gene. Usually if a mom has this gene every sibling has a 50/50 chance of inheriting it from their mother. A patient might see women in his family, sisters, moms, cousins, aunts, that have breast cancer or ovarian cancer.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p><strong>Dr. Harris: </strong>Mastectomy is almost always the course of action because there is so little tissue. Some men also receive medical therapy such as chemotherapy or hormonal therapy in the form of anti-estrogen medication.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Patch: </strong>What type of examinations can males do at home and do doctors teach them this on visits like women?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Dr. Lee:</strong> They can self exam, but if a man is not at high risk I don't think they are taught to do the self exam compared to women who are taught this in routine doctor visits. But in the face of no high risk issues the men are not learning. Usually men discover they have breast cancer because they feel a lump when they are putting on their clothes, or maybe they experience discomfort in the area.</p>\n\

    							<p>GREEN, Ohio -- ATM maker Diebold Inc. says it has changed its mind about building a $100 million global headquarters in northern Ohio. </p>
    <p>However, the $2.8 billion technology company said it is committed to keeping its existing Ohio operations in Green, near Akron. </p>
    <p>The company said Thursday it was suspending "indefinitely" its plans to build new corporate headquarters in Ohio in order to focus on growing its business. </p>
    <p>Diebold's overseas operations have been battered in recent months. </p>
    <p>As part of its cost-cutting efforts, Diebold will eliminate about 500 jobs in North America and Brazil over the next 30 days, including fewer than 75 positions in northeast Ohio. </p>
    <p>The company has about 2,000 employees in the state. </p>
    <p>The company broke the news to Ohio officials and local employees this week. </p>

    			  <p><em>By Diane Smith | Staff Writer</em></p><p>Excited children painted and rolled pumpkins and jumped rope to celebrate the Ravenna Downtown Farmers Market&rsquo;s last day Thursday.</p><p>Area children enjoyed temperatures in the upper 70s as they excitedly painted and rolled the produce, while their parents took the opportunity to do some shopping themselves. Several vendors also brought their children along to enjoy the fun.</p><p>The market, which opened this spring, had its last day on Thursday, a week earlier than the original Nov. 1 closing date.</p><p>Organizers marked the day with an &ldquo;Oktoberfest&rdquo; featuring live music and activities for children.</p><p>&ldquo;The kids are having a blast,&rdquo; said market manager Kelly Ferry, adding that the weather was &ldquo;spectacular&rdquo; and brought a big crowd during the early hours. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t have asked for better weather for our last day.&rdquo;</p>  <p> <p>The jump rope contest, sponsored by the Ravenna Fit Chicks, was originally open only to children between the ages of 8 and 10, but was opened to other children who expressed an interest. Leslie Keegan of the Fit Chicks said the goal was to encourage children to exercise.</p><p>Each child got to keep a jump rope, and winners in each age category were presented with Frisbees, water bottle, T-shirts and pedometers.</p><p>Jenna Kendrick of Ravenna brought her three children to the market. Arystah, 8, was the winner of the jump rope contest in her age category with 49 jumps. Alaynah, 6 and Ayden, 4, took part in the contests, with Ayden scoring well in the pumpkin roll.</p><p>Kendrick said her oldest daughter had been in gymnastics and instantly took to the jump rope contest.<br>&ldquo;She does it so fast,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>She said the family often comes to the market, and will miss it when it closes for the season.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a great thing for the community,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Mayor Joseph Bica came to watch the festivities.</p><p>&ldquo;I think we had an exceptional season, and we are looking forward to next year,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be bigger and better, and maybe relocated.&rdquo;</p><p>The city is considering redeveloping an old concrete plant for use as a city park, and is applying for grant money to make the park a reality.</p><p>Brennady Barnes, a 13-year-old violinist from Stow, played alongside Jon Mosely during the last 30 minutes of Mosely&rsquo;s performance. After Mosely left, Brennady stayed on to perform several songs for the crowd.</p><p>Her parents, Don and Shonnet Barnes, said their daughter started playing the violin about three years ago, and this is the first time she&rsquo;s branched out into solo performances, mostly at farmers markets. In addition to the Ravenna market, she also has performed at the Haymaker Farmers Market, which Ferry also manages, and the market in Stow.</p><p>She said she enjoyed the chance to play beside Mosely.</p><p>&ldquo;It was really fun, and it just enhances it so much when you have another instrument playing along with you,&rdquo; she said.</p><p><em>Contact this reporter at 330-298-1139 or <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.recordpub.com%2fnews%2farticle%2fmailto%3adsmith%40recordpub.com">dsmith@recordpub.com</a></em></p></p>

    <p>There are good acronyms, and there are not so good acronyms. With <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexingtonma.gov%2fSelectmen%2fcommittee%2fGreenway.cfm\">ACROSS Lexington</a>, the town's <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexingtonma.gov%2fSelectmen%2fcommittee%2fGreenway.cfm\">Greenways Corridor Committee</a> believes it has a an acronym that's working out quite nicely.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>ACROSS stands for Accessing Conservation land, Recreation areas, Open  space, Schools and Streets and it's the major initiative of the Greenways Corridor Committee. The goal is to create 40 miles of well marked walking/running/biking routes linking trails, schools and conservation land around town. And it starts with a pilot route of 5.5 miles, which opens this weekend.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><blockquote>&#13;\n\
    <p>(Watch the video to your right to hear more about ACROSS Lexington and the pilot.)</p>&#13;\n\
    </blockquote><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The pilot route, like those to come, connects with the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexington.patch.com%2flistings%2fminuteman-bikeway\">Minuteman Bikeway</a>, which will act as sort of a \"spine\" for the eventual network of ACROSS Lexington trails. Individually and as a whole, the trail network will promote alternative passive recreation and transportation options.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Lexington\xC2\xA0 has all of treasure trove of resources, and this is a way to connect them all,\" said Keith Ohmart, chairman of the Greenways Corridor Committee. \"It's a different way of thinking of and linking those resources.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The routes throughout the network are largely existing roads and trails, which will be marked with ACROSS Lexington sinage and posts. A map will depict each route.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Greenways Corridor Committee is hoping to complete additional routes over the next three years and eventually link the 40  miles, according to Rick Abrams, co-chairman of the committee. To guide the work, they're using a map provided by the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexingtonma.gov%2fcommittees%2fconservationcom.cfm\">Conservation Commission</a> that includes overlaid conservation lands. Schools will also be along the routes, providing another safe option for students to and from school.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>After the pilot route comes onboard this weekend, Abrans said the committee will be looking for feedback from the public about sinage and whatever else comes to mind. The best way to submit that feedback, he said, is through a link on <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexingtonma.gov%2fSelectmen%2fcommittee%2fGreenway.cfm\">the committee's website, which you can access here</a>.</p>\n\

    <p>Tired of giving out the same fun-sized bags of candy on Halloween? Looking for a perhaps healthier or non-food idea to hand out on the upcoming holiday? Patch Picks is providing some ideas, with just a few days left before the Oct. 31 holiday.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>I'll start with a disclaimer that I'm not to be blamed if your house gets egged or toilet papered by little ghouls or goblins whose sweet tooth you angered by handing out pencils or raisins.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>That said, you might be looking for some Halloween candy alternatives. Here's some inspiration:</p><p>&#13;
    </p><ul><li><strong>Dried fruits: </strong>Raisins were never popular when I was growing up, but they are good on oatmeal or in cookies. Dried cranberries, bananas, apricots or trail mixes are also good ideas. They're less real, but fruit snacks can be popular with kids.</li>&#13;
    <li><strong>Nuts:</strong> You don't get them on many planes anymore, but the fun-sized bags of nuts still do exist. Trick or Treaters might just go nuts for your selection. (Sorry, couldn't resist...)</li>&#13;
    <li><strong>Snacks:</strong> Goldfish crackers, peanut butter crackers, or other totable items might make parents thank you when it comes to packing school lunches.</li>&#13;
    <li><strong>School supplies:</strong> Who couldn't use another pencil, pen or eraser? Bonus points for Halloween-themed items. </li>&#13;
    <li><strong>Homemade treats:</strong> A lot of these end up in the trash can thanks to razor-blade fearing parents. But if you live in a tight-knit neighborhood where everyone knows your name, take a crack at a homemade treat like popcorn balls, Rice Krispy treats or another concoction from your cauldron.</li>&#13;
    </ul><p>Most of these items can be found at <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2flistings%2fcrosbys-marketplace">Crosby's</a>, <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2flistings%2fconcord-convenience">Concord Convenience</a> or other local stores. Plus, your kids can stock up on eggs and toilet paper while you're forgoing the candy aisle (we're kidding, of course).</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Do you have other non-candy Halloween hand-out ideas? Leave yours in the comments.</p>

    <p>View the new exhibit at the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.concordart.org%2f\">Concord Art Association</a>, 37 Lexington Rd., for its new exhibit that runs through November 18.  <strong>It is about art and food.</strong> This exhibit brings together artists who work in a variety of media and materials \xC2\x96 including edible ones \xC2\x96 to express a range of intentions. Some artists use food imagery as a metaphor for human relations and society\xC2\x92s challenges, others to celebrate memory, while others delve into the complexities of the structure of food itself \xC2\x96 exploring line, color, pattern, and space. In conjunction with this exhibit, Concord Art Association will be collecting donations of canned goods for <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.opentable.org%2f\">Open Table</a> through November 18.</p>\n\n\
    <p>And at the <strong>Emerson Umbrella</strong>, be sure to catch an exhibit featuring Kayo Burmon, resident artist at the Umbrella, with a collection of very diverse works created over the last few years. Kayo explains, \"Sleepless nights are common among artists. It is no wonder. Days are replete with action, colors, patterns, images, shapes, sounds, emotions, light and dark, people, stories, news, illness, birth, death, experiences\xC2\x96both painful and pleasant\xC2\x96nature\xC2\x92s best and worst\xC2\x85. To distill all this in a way that can be translated into a work of art is an enigma. The result? Sleepless nights.\"  Free.</p>\n\n\
    <p><strong>The Concord Museum</strong> has a new exhibit, \xC2\x93<em>The Greatest Source of Wealth: Agriculture in Concord</em>,\xC2\x94 in the Wallace Kane Gallery through March 17, 2013. </p>\n\n\
    <p>The <strong>library </strong>has an agricultural exhibit in conjunction with the Museum. Visit 129 Main Street to take it in. The display is part of a collaborative focus on farming between the library, the Concord Museum, and ConcordCAN. The program offerings include two exhibitions (the library's and also one at the Concord Museum), a film series, a lecture series, and a book discussion of \"The Dirty Life\" by Kristin Kimball (a featured \"Concord Reads\" book). </p>\n\n\
    <p>The town runs on volunteer energy and commitment. The following <strong>boards and committees have openings</strong>.

    <p>Lexington\xC2\x92s Department of Public works is asking residents to assist with clearing leaves from storm drains in front of their property in preparation for possible heavy rains early next week.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Crews from the department are already clearing storm drains and brook culverts in anticipation of high winds and rain that could be caused by Hurricane Sandy early next week.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The hurricane is forecast to hit around the Delaware/New Jersey border early Tuesday and the large storm is expected to impact New England.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Lexington officials issued a press release Friday afternoon requesting that residents assist in the storm drain cleanups because of the amount of foliage that has been dropping quickly and is making it impossible to clear all  5,000 drains and catch basins in the town by Sunday evening.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The town is asking that residents check the storm drains, rake away any leaves or pine needles and dispose of the leaves and debris in yard waste bins or paper leaf bags. For more tips about preparing for the storm, the town is encouraging residents to visit the website of the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.mass.gov%2feopss%2fagencies%2fmema%2fmema-offers-tips-as-hurricane-sandy-approaches.html\">Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency</a> .</p></div>\n\n\

    </p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>This Saturday, Oct. 27 <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fsaveourheritage.com%2f\">Save Our Heritage</a> and <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2flistings%2fminute-man-national-historical-park\">Minute Man National Historical Park</a> are holding an event to celebrate the completion of the Save Our Heritage restoration of Barrett Farm, and the transfer of its ownership to the National Park Service, Minute Man National Historical Park.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A public ceremony with U.S. Rep Niki Tsongas and others will take place at Barrett Farm, 448 Barretts Mill Road, Concord at 11 a.m., followed by an Open House from noon to 4 p.m.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Restoration of the historic Barrett House, built in 1705, began eight years ago when Save Our Heritage (SOH), a Concord-based nonprofit preservation organization, acquired Barrett Farm and the 3.4 acres of surrounding land from the McGrath family.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CIt was a collaborative effort right from the start between Save Our Heritage, the Town, the Park, and the McGraths,\xE2\x80\x9D said Neil Rasmussen, president of SOH.\xC2\xA0 \xE2\x80\x9COur shared goal was to have Save Our Heritage restore the Col. James Barrett House to the way it was during Revolutionary times, and to eventually incorporate it into Minute Man Park so that visitors could experience it as living history. And that time has finally come.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Col. James Barrett Farm is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as one of the most important Revolutionary War landmarks of national significance. Col. James Barrett, a member of the Provincial Congress, was the senior officer and overall field commander at the North Bridge in the first battle of the American Revolution. He was also in charge of all the supplies in the area, enough for an army of 15,000. When the British Regulars marched to Concord on April 19, 1775, they were intent on seizing weapons and other military supplies stored throughout the town, including a major stockpile on Colonel Barrett\xE2\x80\x99s property.\xC2\xA0The farm and the Barrett family provide a central link to the story of \xE2\x80\x9Cthe shot heard \xE2\x80\x98round the world.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Barrett property has been farmed continuously from Colonial times to the present, and has been owned by only two families over the past 300 years -- the Barretts for 200 of those years, and the McGraths for 100. Michael McGrath now resides in a house behind the Col. James Barrett house, and his late brother Patrick farmed the surrounding land and ran the McGrath Farmstand across the road.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Since 2004, the exterior restoration of Barrett House has seen the stabilization of the back wall; completion of a new wood roof; application of hand-skived pine clapboards; and the installation of handmade replications of the original 1770\xE2\x80\x99s doors and faithful reproductions of the original window frames and sash.\xC2\xA0In addition, archaeological studies were conducted, and the land behind the house was cleared to reveal a more open agrarian landscape. Painstaking restoration and preservation of the interior of the house has included stabilizing of original plaster walls; repointing of fireboxes; and the restoration of wood paneling and floors.\xC2\xA0In addition, careful paint conservation techniques have revealed many original and exceedingly rare colonial paint surfaces.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CMuch of our restoration work employed methods and materials used in the 18th century, wherever possible,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jim Cunningham, the project manager forSOH-Barrett Farm.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The wood used to stabilize the post and beam structure was hand-hewn by traditional timber framers, and wrought iron reproduction hardware was fashioned by Concord\xE2\x80\x99s local blacksmith, Carl Close. As a result of this meticulous attention to details, when visitors enter the house, they are transported to Revolutionary times and can sense a direct, living, tangible link to the beginning of our nation.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>This eight-year restoration project was generously funded by four CPA grants from the town of Concord, a Save America\xE2\x80\x99s Treasures grant from the Department of the Interior, and numerous private donations. Many town departments and committees have provided critical assistance and dozens of volunteers and organizations, including the Boy Scouts, have donated their time and effort to the project.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CRestoring Barrett Farm was only one part of the preservation effort. Getting it incorporated into Minute Man National Historical Park was the other part, and this involved a three-part process at the federal level spanning several years,\xE2\x80\x9D said Anna West Winter, executive director of SOH. \xE2\x80\x9CIn 2005, the late Senator Edward Kennedy and former Representative Marty Meehan lent their energetic support to sponsoring legislation to facilitate a feasibility study of the farm's inclusion in the Park.\xC2\xA0 Later,\xE2\x80\x9D Winter adds, \xE2\x80\x9Cin 2009, thanks to the steadfast leadership of Congresswoman Niki Tsongas, Minute Man Park\xE2\x80\x99s boundaries were expanded by Congressional legislation to include the Col. James Barrett House and additional surrounding acres.\xE2\x80\x9D\xC2\xA0Finally, this year Congress appropriated the funds needed for the National Park Service to acquire Barrett House and the surrounding land.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CWe\xE2\x80\x99re delighted to finally have the Col. James Barrett House incorporated into Minute Man National Historical Park,\xE2\x80\x9D stated the Park\xE2\x80\x99s Supertintendent, Nancy Nelson.\xC2\xA0 \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s something we have been looking forward to for a long time. Barrett Farm completes the narrative of the beginning of the American Revolution within the Park.\xE2\x80\x9D\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Barrett Farm Celebration on October 27 at 11:00 a.m. will be held outside on the lawn, rain or shine at 448 Barretts Mill Road.\xC2\xA0</p>\n\

    <p>The latest track of Hurricane Sandy has the storm pushing farther west according to this morning\xE2\x80\x99s meteorologists' reports. The National Hurricane Center has the center of the storm going either into southern New Jersey or Delaware.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>But this is a constantly changing storm, and a more northern track, which is possible, would signficicantly affect us here in New England.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>According to WHDH Meteorologist <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww1.whdh.com%2fweather%2fblog%2fpage%2f1%2f\">Chris Lambert,</a> the current likely scenario would bring wind and rain Monday afternoon through Tuesday with wind gusts of 40-60 mph, mostly onshore, strongest at the coast with up to 5 inches of rain expected throughout the storm\xE2\x80\x99s duration. Power outages are likely, along with beach erosion and coastal flooding during high tides.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Lambert says it\xE2\x80\x99s still a \xE2\x80\x9Cvery complicated and anomalous pattern\xE2\x80\x9D and thus the timing is tricky.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>If Sandy maintains a warm core longer into the forecast period, it may hold on longer than some of the models project. If that happens, the turn northwest into the coast would happen farther north and put southern New England in a more serious situation than the current path would take it. \xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nhc.noaa.gov%2ftext%2frefresh%2fMIATCPAT3%2bshtml%2f260848.shtml\">National Hurricane Center </a>has the hurricane currently with sustained winds of 80 mph, moving north at 13 mph. The storm is expected to decrease in speed today, followed by a turn toward the north tonight, and a turn toward the northeast on Saturday. The center of the storm will continue moving near the northwestern Bahamas this morning and move north of the Bahamas tonight.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Hurricane force winds extend outward up to 35 miles from the center, with tropical storm force winds extending up to 275 miles. Sandy\xE2\x80\x99s wind field is expected to grow in size during the next couple of days.</p>\n\

    \t\t\t\t\t<p>State and federal officials continue to investigate an outbreak of hepatitis C at Exeter Hospital in New Hampshire. The outbreak, in a cardiac cathertization lab, may be the result of an infected worker replacing sterile syringes with used ones while stealing drugs, investigators have said. Globe correspondent Helen Shun <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2fnews%2flocal%2fmassachusetts%2farticles%2f2012%2f06%2f16%2fnh_public_health_officials_suspect_hospital_worker_in_hepatitis_outbreak%2f%3fpage%3dfull\">wrote about the case earlier this month</a>. </p>\n\
    <p>At least 20 people, including one employee, have tested positive for the virus, though more have joined a class action lawsuit. One, a 49-year-old man who has not publicly given his name, has talked about the experience. </p>\n\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CSpeak up,\xE2\x80\x9D she writes. \xE2\x80\x9CCome out. Tell us your names.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\
    <p>She goes on: \xE2\x80\x9CThe secrecy surrounding HCV has big consequences. Public health officials have long struggled to determine how many Americans have HCV, but most estimates put the figure somewhere between 3 million and 4 million.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\
    <p>Heckman, a longtime friend and mentor, knows what she\xE2\x80\x99s talking about. She contracted hepatitis C through a blood transfusion when she was an infant. <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.concordmonitor.com%2fhcv\">In 2010, she wrote a moving series</a> about the role the disease plays in her life, her struggle with the stigma of hepatitis, and her experience in a clinical trial testing drugs expected to cure it.</p>\n\
    <p>Heckman calls the surging numbers of people in the United States expected to be diagnosed with hepatitis C in the coming years -- and the cost to care for them -- \xE2\x80\x9Cdizzying.\xE2\x80\x9D But, she says, \xE2\x80\x9CI believe that small acts - like debunking rumors, smashing stereotypes and disclosing your infection - can make a big difference.\xE2\x80\x9D </p>\r\n\

    <p>Gov. Deval Patrick has declared a state of emergency and held a press conference Saturday afternoon to update the public about how the state is preparing for the impact of Hurricane Sandy.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Sandy is currently a category 1 hurricane rolling up the Atlantic and is expected to turn northwest Sunday afternoon. Impact on New England from the storm is expected by Sunday night and could linger until Wednesday.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"While we continue to hope for the best, we are planning for the worst," Patrick said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>There may be coastal flooding, severe beach erosion, damaging winds, widespread power outages, and possibly 5 inches or more of rain.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"This afternoon I declared a state of emergency Commonwealth-wide," Patrick said. "This enables us to cut through some of the red tape sometimes involved in securing the necessary services, supplies and personnel I want to be sure we have in advance of Hurricane Sandy reaching us."</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Patrick added that there were 200 National Guard members on duty Saturday and would be 1,000 on duty by Monday to supply armories, fill sandbags, assist victims and transport emergency personnel.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>The administration is also in constant contact with utility companies, as widespread power outages are expected.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Patrick advised residents to complete any errands they may have by Sunday evening. Residents may be asked to stay off the roads during the storm. For T-service updates, customers are urged to visit <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fmbta.com">mbta.com.</a></p><p>&#13;

    </p><p>So what better time of year than Halloween\xC2\xA0to indulge in stories that make our spines tingle?\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>It's the perfect time\xC2\xA0for your family to share some spooky stories each evening. To get you started, here are some Halloween books filled with ghosts and ghouls, wizards and witches, haunted houses and black magic that everyone can enjoy together.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    &#13;\n\
    </p><p>Children ages 2-6 love the fun of Halloween: costumes, trick-or-treating and gentle tales of ghosts and goblins. Here are some books for this age group:</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ul><li><strong>\"Ghosts in the House\" by\xC2\xA0Kazuno Kohara\xE2\x80\x94</strong>There are fuzzy pumpkin costumes in sizes as small as 6 months, so why not a Halloween board book for toddlers?

In a twist on the sheet-as-ghost costume, our little witch gathers the pesky ghosts, puts them in the washing machine, hangs them on the line, and makes bed sheets out of them.\xC2\xA0Stylishly illustrated in orange and black, this story has just right balance for very young children. (Ages 1-6)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>\"Go Away, Big Green Monster!\" by\xC2\xA0Ed Emberley</strong>\xE2\x80\x94This big-faced monster has two yellow eyes, a long blue nose, sharp white teeth, two little squiggly ears, scraggly purple hair and a scary green face. (Ages 3-6)</li>&#13;\n\

    <li><strong>\"The Monster Returns\" by\xC2\xA0Peter McCarty</strong>\xE2\x80\x94When the phone rings and Jeremy\xE2\x80\x99s blue monster announces that he is bored and coming back, Jeremy invites his friends over to draw their own monsters.

Why not?\xC2\xA0 She uses her \xE2\x80\x9Cstrange abilities\xE2\x80\x9D to get whatever she wants\xE2\x80\x94from her favorite lunch to a new red sweater\xE2\x80\x94until she meets her matches in Bella Yaga and the Mandrake, who adopt her.\xC2\xA0 Her new home is strange to be sure: rooms change boundaries, smells and sights appear and disappear, and Thomas, the black cat, can talk.

    <p><a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nhc.noaa.gov%2f%23SANDY">Sandy has been upgraded again to a hurricane</a> just hours after being downgraded to a tropical storm, according to The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA),</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>In its 8 a.m. bulletin, the NOAA reported an Air Force aircraft found hurricane-strength winds again of 75 mph, just enough to push Sandy over the 74 mph threshold between tropical storm and hurricane.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>The latest track shows that Sandy will make landfall in southern New Jersey, but New England will certainly feel its effects.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"Storm track not likely to matter at this point," according to a <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=https%3a%2f%2ftwitter.com%2fcbsboston%2fstatus%2f262175202690088960">Tweet from CBS Boston</a>. "Sandy takes aim at New England."</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Jeremy Reiner writes on the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww1.whdh.com%2fweather%2fblog%2fpage%2f1%2f%23ixzz2AVNea0nr">WHDH weather blog</a> that he expects this area to feel the earliest effects of Sandy on Monday morning with some rain and wind. The worst of Sandy's impact, however, Reiner expects to occur "in the window of 11 a.m. Monday to 2 a.m. Tuesday.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Reiner writes:</p><p>&#13;
    </p><blockquote>&#13;
    <p>"Within this period is our greatest risk of wind damage/power loss. Many  towns will experience wind gusts over 40mph during this time and  coastal cities and towns may see wind gusts between 50-60mph. the  concern isn't so much the speed itself but the duration as several hours  of 40mph wind gusts may be able to bring down trees &amp; power lines."</p>&#13;
    </blockquote><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Reiner goes on to say that he believes "rainfall looks manageable," with most towns expected to receive from 1-3 inches.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>In its 5 a.m. bulletin, the NOAA issued warnings and watches to the Southeastern parts of the country, including Florida, but said those up the Eastern seaboard need to prepare for its impact. The storm is moving North-Northeast at 10 mph and an increase in intensity and speed possible tonight and Sunday, <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nhc.noaa.gov%2ftext%2frefresh%2fMIATCPAT3%2bshtml%2f270846.shtml">according to the NOAA</a>.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Sandy is currently considered to be "very large," with winds extending as far as 450 miles from its center.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>The storm killed more than 40 people as it moved through the Caribbean.</p>

    				<p>    I have been reading essays by Ralph Waldo Emerson, specifically his treatise on History, which he denies the existence of, but he does mention that Biographies are real.  He compares man to mosquitoes, leaves, and other forms of life.  He argues that all history is subjective because it is formulated to propogate an explanation for a political leader&#8217;s decisions.  Biographies, he argues are  more relevant because they are objective.  He makes a good point. </p>
    <p>     What does that have to do with my mind?  Probably not much but it is interesting fodder for a good philosophical discussion.  &#8220;Nature is a mutable cloud, which is always and never the same.&#8221;  I like to read older writing because the writer is now perhaps wiser than we are in our world of Internet Technology.  Instant gratification is  like printing on your computer or putting your ideas on a blog.  I am guilty of doing both. </p>
    <p>     One thing that does make older authors interesting is their lack of knowledge of the two second sound bite.  They write from their knowledge and from their hearts.  They do not form their opinion based on a small amount of information, they come to their conclusion in an argumentative way, they use their writing to change opinions or clarify theirs.  We are voting for one of the most important Presidents of the United States based on two second sound bites, not volumes of position papers.  Is there any wonder that we are frightened of our choices?  We have not written, like Emerson did, great treatises on our thoughts.  We need to.  It might be boring, we might have few ideas, but our ideas are as important as Emerson&#8217;s.  What we need to do is write them down and not send them through Facebook or Twitter. </p>
    <p>     What we have to do is try to get our ideas published.  In Thoreau&#8217;s time it was not uncommon to spend your own money to be published.  His book on traveling the Concord and Merrimack Rivers was self-published,  My father, Wayne Peters, wrote a very good, engrossing book about the Middlesex Canal.  He paid for their publication and I still get orders for them even now.  We all have a book in us, publish it.</p>
    <p>     As always, I have a few comments on the election.  First, the presidential race.  I noticed on the news that the President was appealing very favorably to the younger voter.  I also noticed that Mitt Romney was  appealing to the white male voter.  When my brother-in-law, Paul Tsongas, announced that he was going to run against Edward Brooke, the black Senator from Massachusetts, he was asked how he could justify it in his own mind.  &#8220;I believe we have crossed that barrier&#8221; he countered.  We had not totally.    John Sununu tonight implied that Colin Powell endorsed Barach Obama because of their mutual skin color, not the virtues of their intellects.  I personally believe that race is in that picture.</p>
    <p>     On the Senatorial side, Scott Brown has finally come up with some good commercials saying what he stands for, and why.  For too long, he has been in a mad, as in barely fathomable, attack mode.  Now his latest commercials are decent and about his goals.  Elizabeth Warren is trying to make a niche in the fact that a vote for Scott Brown could turn the Senate into a Republican body.  That is a good tactic, a fair one. </p>
    <p>     On the Congressional side, Jon Golnik had quite a few supporters, who did not follow the moderator&#8217;s rules, by the way, at a debate I had the pleasure of attending.  Niki Tsongas had the best line, however, when she said that Golnik, if sent to Congress, would be &#8220;irrelevant&#8221; because of a pledge he signed which would keep him from being able to vote on financing the government.  That is just what we need and want, a Congressman without a wish to fund the government.  With all of the millions of dollars that Niki has brought into the district through negotiation, she deserves to be returned.</p>
    <p>     So, what are my predictions?  Well, I have made them to a few people.  We shall see if I will be right.</p>

    <p>Gov. Deval Patrick has declared a state of emergency and held a press conference Saturday afternoon to update the public about how the state is preparing for the impact of Hurricane Sandy.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Sandy is currently a category 1 hurricane rolling up the Atlantic and is expected to turn northwest Sunday afternoon. Impact on New England from the storm is expected by Sunday night and could linger until Wednesday.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"While we continue to hope for the best, we are planning for the worst," Patrick said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>There may be coastal flooding, severe beach erosion, damaging winds, widespread power outages, and possibly 5 inches or more of rain.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"This afternoon I declared a state of emergency Commonwealth-wide," Patrick said. "This enables us to cut through some of the red tape sometimes involved in securing the necessary services, supplies and personnel I want to be sure we have in advance of Hurricane Sandy reaching us."</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Patrick added that there were 200 National Guard members on duty Saturday and would be 1,000 on duty by Monday to supply armories, fill sandbags, assist victims and transport emergency personnel.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>The administration is also in constant contact with utility companies, as widespread power outages are expected.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Patrick advised residents to complete any errands they may have by Sunday evening. Residents may be asked to stay off the roads during the storm. For T-service updates, customers are urged to visit <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fmbta.com">mbta.com.</a></p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Check with Patch for updates leading up to, during and after the storm.</p>

And, as that work commences, the town is asking that residents assist those crews and work with neighbors to clear storm drains in front of their property and along their roadway.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>As of the morning of Saturday, Oct. 27, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nhc.noaa.gov%2f%23SANDY\">Sandy has been upgraded again to a hurricane</a> just hours after being downgraded to a tropical storm, according to The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). Though the storm\xE2\x80\x99s current track looks like Sandy will make landfall in southern New Jersey, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwayland.patch.com%2farticles%2fsandy-regains-hurricane-strength\">the consensus is that New England will feel the storm\xE2\x80\x99s effects</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The DPW has had multiple crews out clearing storm drains on a daily  basis.\xC2\xA0 However, Lexington has over 5,000 storm drains/catchbasins and  the trees have been dropping the fall foliage quickly which makes it  impossible to clear all drains by Sunday evening. As such, town leaders are asking residents to check storm drains, rake leaves  and pine needles away from the drain (not into the drain) and dispose of  the leaves and debris in yard waste bins or brown paper leaf bags. However, <strong>do not remove the storm grates</strong>.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>As well, the town is asking residents not to rake or blow leaves from your property into the street,  as street sweepers cannot pick up large piles of leaves.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>The latest track shows that Sandy will make landfall in southern New Jersey, but New England will certainly feel its effects.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"Storm track not likely to matter at this point," according to a <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=https%3a%2f%2ftwitter.com%2fcbsboston%2fstatus%2f262175202690088960">Tweet from CBS Boston</a>. "Sandy takes aim at New England."</p><p>&#13;

The worst of Sandy's impact, however, Reiner expects to occur "in the window of 11 a.m. Monday to 2 a.m. Tuesday.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Reiner writes:</p><p>&#13;
    </p><blockquote>&#13;
    <p>"Within this period is our greatest risk of wind damage/power loss. Many  towns will experience wind gusts over 40mph during this time and  coastal cities and towns may see wind gusts between 50-60mph. the  concern isn't so much the speed itself but the duration as several hours  of 40mph wind gusts may be able to bring down trees &amp; power lines."</p>&#13;
    </blockquote><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Reiner goes on to say that he believes "rainfall looks manageable," with most towns expected to receive from 1-3 inches.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>In its 5 a.m. bulletin, the NOAA issued warnings and watches to the Southeastern parts of the country, including Florida, but said those up the Eastern seaboard need to prepare for its impact. The storm is moving North-Northeast at 10 mph and an increase in intensity and speed possible tonight and Sunday, <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nhc.noaa.gov%2ftext%2frefresh%2fMIATCPAT3%2bshtml%2f270846.shtml">according to the NOAA</a>.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Sandy is currently considered to be "very large," with winds extending as far as 450 miles from its center.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>The storm killed more than 40 people as it moved through the Caribbean.</p>

    <p><em>The following information was provided on behalf of the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.llwv.org\">League of Women Voters of Lexington</a>. </em></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Since the election of 2010, a number of states have passed  laws that have imposed new voter ID requirements and restricted access  to the polls. These laws reverse a trend, begun with the Voting Rights  Act of 1965, to make voting more accessible to all Americans.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Opponents  of these laws worry that they will have a disproportionate effect on the  ability of racial minority voters, as well as the less affluent and  students, to vote in 2012. Many worry (or hope) that these laws will  have an influence on who wins the presidency in November.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>This  talk, to be held at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 30 at the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexington.patch.com%2flistings%2flexington-depot\">Lexington Depot</a>, discusses the rise of these laws, which are intended to tighten-up  access to the polls, and the larger political context that has led to  their passage. Despite the clearly partisan politics of these laws,  Professor Stewart will discuss why they are unlikely to have much of an  influence on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election. This is not  to say that problems with election administration more generally  couldn't lead to a repeat of the 2000 fiasco. Many of the \"battleground  states\" have features of their voting systems that could lead to  controversy, conflict, and chaos, should the results of the election  rest on an election dispute in one of these states.\xC2\xA0</p><p><strong>About the Speaker:\xC2\xA0</strong>Charles  Stewart III is the Kenan Sahin Distinguished Professor of Political  Science at MIT, where he has taught since 1985. His research and  teaching areas include congressional politics, elections, and American  political development. His current research about Congress touches on  the historical development of committees, party leadership, and Senate  elections. Since 2001, Professor Stewart has been a member of the  Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project, a leading research effort that  applies scientific analysis to questions about election technology,  election administration, and election reform. He is currently the MIT  director of the project. Professor Stewart is an established leader in  the analysis of the performance of election systems and the quantitative  assessment of election performance.</p>\n\

    <p><a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nhc.noaa.gov%2f\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hurricane Sandy</a> is currently moving northeastward off the coast of the southeastern United States.

Deep moisture from the Atlantic is being pushed westward across the Mid Atlantic states and into <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.examiner.com%2ftopic%2fohio\" class=\"inline_link\">Ohio</a>.  This moisture, interacting with an old frontal boundary, has caused <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.examiner.com%2ftopic%2frain\" class=\"inline_link\">rain</a> to break out across the Akron area.  The rain will continue through the afternoon, and it could be heavy at times.  High temperatures this afternoon will reach the upper 40s.</p>\n\
    <p>Sandy will continue to linger off the cost tonight, with moisture continuing to stream westward across our area.  Rain will persist, and it could be heavy at times.  Overnight lows will fall to around 40 degrees.</p>\n\
    <p>On Monday, a large upper level trough will dig across the eastern U.S., capturing <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.examiner.com%2ftopic%2fhurricane\" class=\"inline_link\">Hurricane</a> Sandy and turning her northwestward toward the Mid Atlantic coast.  Rain and <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.examiner.com%2ftopic%2fwind\" class=\"inline_link\">wind</a> will increase across the area, especially Monday afternoon as the system approaches the coast.  High temperatures on Monday will be in the mid 40s.</p>\n\
    <p>The strongest winds and heaviest rains are expected across the Akron area Monday night and Tuesday as Sandy moves onshore across New Jersey, then west into Pennsylvania.  During this time frame, winds could gust 50 to 60 mph with occasional stronger gusts possible.  Trees and power lines will likely be toppled causing scattered power outages.  The NWS has issued a <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.erh.noaa.gov%2fer%2fcle%2f\" rel=\"nofollow\">High Wind Watch</a> for the Akron area through Tuesday. </p>\n\
    <p>In addition to the wind, heavy rains of 3 to 6 inches with locally higher amounts will be possible, in addition to what falls this weekend.  The NWS has also posted a <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.erh.noaa.gov%2fer%2fcle%2f\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flood Watch</a> for the Akron area through Tuesday.</p>\n\
    <p>Winds will gradually diminish on Wednesday, but the rains will persist.</p>\n\
    <p>This is going to be a long duration, high impact event.  Stay tuned for updates throughout the day on my <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.facebook.com%2fffnortheastohio\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook page</a> .</p>\n\

    </p><p>An employee quickly called security on the man. A report said he was wearing earrings and carrying a pink backpack and black purse.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Mall security asked the man to leave, then <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fstrongsville.patch.com%2farticles%2fman-in-pink-says-he-s-pregnant-police-blotter\">escorted him out</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>A man went to the restaurant around 1 p.m. on Oct. 21, but decided to treat a hostess rudely during lunch.</p><p>&#13;\n\

  content: "<div><div> <div class='story'><p>Campfire embers grew cold in the dark. The boys were in their tents, in sleeping bags or under blankets, when the predators came out.</p> <p class=\"p1\">The men who crept among the Boy Scouts weren\xE2\x80\x99t stalking game. They sought sexual gratification.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Many of their activities were recorded in confidential files kept by the Boy Scouts of America. Along with wrenching details of sexual abuse, the files -- parts of which have surfaced recently through lawsuits -- illustrate how the Boy Scouts frequently failed to protect youths within the organization and beyond. Too often, allegations were treated as Scout secrets and not referred to law enforcement.</p> <p class=\"p1\">One failure involved John P.\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\" data-scaytid=\"1\">Treder</span>, a scoutmaster accused of molesting a boy in his troop while at a southeastern Wisconsin Scout camp on a July night in 1968. But the details of his misconduct would remain a Scout secret for more than two decades, surfacing only in 1991. The time span encompasses that of a set of nearly 1,900 files reviewed by a Scripps investigative team.</p> <p class=\"p1\"> <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\" data-scaytid=\"2\">Treder</span>\xC2\xA0lay on the boy\xE2\x80\x99s bunk and \xE2\x80\x9Ctouched me between my legs several times and again asked me if I liked it. I said \xE2\x80\x98no,\xE2\x80\x99 \xE2\x80\x9D the boy wrote in a statement to Scout officials a week later. \xE2\x80\x9CAt first I trusted him because I liked him. Then he said if he could kiss me again, he would go, so I let him.\xE2\x80\x9D</p> <p class=\"p1\">That incident got\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\" data-scaytid=\"4\">Treder</span>\xC2\xA0removed from Scouting, but there was no report to police.\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\" data-scaytid=\"5\">Treder</span>\xC2\xA0later wrote to the Scout executive who handled his removal, thanking him for \xE2\x80\x9Ckeeping everything in confidence.\xE2\x80\x9D</p> <p class=\"p1\"> <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\" data-scaytid=\"8\">Treder</span>\xC2\xA0went on to oversee altar boys\xE2\x80\x99 training at a Catholic Church in the Milwaukee suburb of West Allis, where he was charged with assaulting a 10-year-old in 1989. Only then did police learn of the earlier incident with Scouts.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Scores of other cases noted in these so-called \xE2\x80\x9Cperversion files\xE2\x80\x9D show how leaders who were pushed out of Scouts for sexual offenses, but not reported to police, went on to strike again.</p> <p class=\"p1\">On paper, Scouting has one of the youth-service field\xE2\x80\x99s toughest systems for keeping child molesters out of its million-strong adult leadership corps and away from its 2.7 million youth members. Within a decade of its 1910 founding, the organization started its \"ineligible volunteer files\" on individuals it deemed unfit to participate in Scouting, usually for suspicions or evidence of sexual misconduct with children. Scout officials say the files -- containing assorted Scout correspondence, handwritten notes, legal documents, press clippings and letters from parents and Scouts -- blocked or removed many pedophiles from leadership posts.</p> <p class=\"p1\">But the Scripps investigative team's review of 1,881 such files from 1970 to 1991, ordered released by a California court and shared among an informal network of attorneys representing abuse victims, reveals the Boy Scouts in hundreds of cases failed to report suspicious behavior to law-enforcement authorities. In scores of cases, individuals suspected of child molestation were allowed to remain on probation or to resign quietly, leaving youths at risk in and outside of Scouting. In some cases, protecting the reputation of Scouting took precedence over protecting its young charges, records show. The files suggest at least 2,000 Scouts were victimized.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Scripps\xE2\x80\x99 review includes many of the same files publicly released Oct. 18, under court order, by an Oregon law firm that got them as evidence against the Boy Scouts.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Despite the Boy Scouts\xE2\x80\x99 tightened screening in recent years, the Scripps team also found evidence in court records that at least 13 Scout leaders abused Scouts within the last decade.</p> <p class=\"p1\">The files Scripps reviewed indicate:</p> <p class=\"p1\">-- Scouts or their parents brought claims of sexual abuse directly to senior Scouting officials 416 times. Officials referred just 117 -- or 28 percent -- to law-enforcement authorities.</p> <p class=\"p1\">-- Scout officials allowed at least 146 individuals suspected of sexual misconduct to resign quietly. Many files contained official Scout correspondence with this standard language: \xE2\x80\x9CPlease also understand that this decision and the reasons for it will be maintained as confidential.\xE2\x80\x9D</p> <p class=\"p1\">-- Thirty-eight Scout leaders accused of sexual molestation were placed on \xE2\x80\x9Cprobation,\xE2\x80\x9D meaning they could continue working with kids as long as there was no further misconduct or while getting therapy. (The Boy Scouts stopped offering probation in 1998.)</p> <p class=\"p1\">Scout officials \xE2\x80\x9Callowed these people to go on to molest other children,\xE2\x80\x9D said Seattle attorney Timothy\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Kosnoff\" data-scaytid=\"10\">Kosnoff</span>, who has represented more than 1,000 victims of child sex abuse and who shared the files with Scripps.</p> <p class=\"p1\">The Boy Scouts\xE2\x80\x99 national president, Wayne Perry, acknowledged the files show his organization \"did not maintain the standards that, certainly, we (have) today. And we fell short,\" he said in an interview with Scripps. \"... And for that -- for any of those victims and their families -- we are profoundly sorry.\"</p> <p class=\"p1\">Boy Scout officials have pledged to review all files from 1965 on to ensure that any suspicions of crime get referred</p></div> <div class='story'><p class=\"p1\">to law enforcement. \xE2\x80\x9CAny information the police want out of our files, they can have,\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 said Perry, a retired Washington state businessman who describes himself as the Boy Scouts\xE2\x80\x99 \xE2\x80\x9Cchief volunteer.\xE2\x80\x9D</p> <p class=\"p1\">Perry also told Scripps that the Boy Scouts' review would include whether Scout leaders had properly handled allegations of abuse: \"There were instances in the past where these people failed. And to the extent that they violated the law, they should be prosecuted. To the extent that they failed to follow our systems, they should be removed from our system.</p> <p class=\"p1\">\"Are we\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"gonna\" data-scaytid=\"11\">gonna</span>\xC2\xA0protect people who made mistakes -- willingly made mistakes? The answer is no.\"</p> <p class=\"p1\">Perry said the Boy Scouts continue keeping internal files -- a measure endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for all youth-serving groups. Providing a confidential outlet for sharing suspicions \xE2\x80\x9Cmakes people more likely\xE2\x80\x9D to report them, Perry said. \"We want to move on suspicions sometimes\" to keep people out of Scouting. \xE2\x80\x9CWe want to act long before convictions.\"</p> <p class=\"p1\">The Boy Scouts' current youth-protection system, with its policy of reporting \"every single instance of suspected child abuse, whether the states require it or not, is better than any other youth-serving organization out there,\xE2\x80\x9D Perry said.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Scouting\xE2\x80\x99s increased emphasis on youth protection comes amid a growing docket of lawsuits filed by Scouts and former Scouts -- and the accompanying negative publicity. Pedophilia scandals in institutions such as the Catholic Church have increased society\xE2\x80\x99s awareness of the threat and intolerance of cover-ups.</p> <p class=\"p1\">The Boy Scouts have been sued in connection with sex abuse more than 100 times since the\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"1980s\" data-scaytid=\"12\">1980s</span>, and at least that many are pending, plaintiff's attorneys representing abuse victims estimate. At least 28 states have no time limit for filing criminal charges related to serious sexual offenses against victims age 15 or younger.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Paul Ernst, the man in charge of the Boy Scouts' confidential files from 1971 until his 1994 retirement, said the records \"kept kids from being abused in any way.\"</p> <p class=\"p1\">\xC2\xA0Interviewed outside his home in Grapevine, Texas, he wore a T-shirt bearing the Scout emblem and proclaiming \"Thanks for the memories.\" Ernst, noting that incidents of molestation were viewed differently 20 or 30 years ago, said he didn't know whether more should have been done then to track predators.</p> <p class=\"p1\">\"I wasn't the policy maker of the Boy Scouts of America, I was just the person handling them,\" he said.</p> <p class=\"p1\">\"I can't look behind me,\" Ernst said. \"... We made decisions then and, as I say, times have changed.\"</p> <p class=\"p1\"> <b>A different era</b></p> <p class=\"p1\">In 1968, after learning that scoutmaster\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\" data-scaytid=\"13\">Treder</span>\xC2\xA0had molested a boy at a Scout camp in Waukesha,\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Wis\" data-scaytid=\"15\">Wis</span>., the Milwaukee County Council banned the West Allis man from Scouting -- but made no report of his conduct to law enforcement nor to the national Boy Scout office.</p> <p class=\"p1\"> <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\" data-scaytid=\"16\">Treder</span>\xC2\xA0later wrote to a council executive, thanking him \xE2\x80\x9Cfor the way you handled everything in Milwaukee. Things could have been much worse for me if you hadn\xE2\x80\x99t kept everything in confidence.\xE2\x80\x9D\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\" data-scaytid=\"17\">Treder</span>\xC2\xA0also wondered whether he somehow could stay involved with Scouts, claiming \xE2\x80\x9Ca gift for working with youth.\xE2\x80\x9D</p> <p class=\"p1\">The executive wrote back that Scouting had no choice but to exclude\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\" data-scaytid=\"20\">Treder</span>, but encouraged him to talk \xE2\x80\x9Cwith your priest and I am sure he can suggest other outlets for your talents.\xE2\x80\x9D</p> <p class=\"p1\">Soon,\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\" data-scaytid=\"22\">Treder</span>\xC2\xA0was overseeing altar boys at St. Aloysius Church in West Allis, where police later determined he molested at least three boys during the\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"1970s\" data-scaytid=\"24\">1970s</span>\xC2\xA0-- and assaulted a 10-year-old boy on Year\xE2\x80\x99s Eve 1983 in a motel room.</p> <p class=\"p1\">The boy delayed reporting the attack until 1989, then drawing police interest in\xC2\xA0  <span data-scayt_word=\"Treder\xE2\x80\x99s\" data-scaytid=\"26\">Treder\xE2\x80\x99s</span>\xC2\xA0past association with Scouting. Boy Scouts officials, at the local council and at national headquarters, took until September 1991 to provide detectives with their records.

    <p>As Hurricane Sandy barrels toward the East Coast, Gov. Deval Patrick held another press conference Sunday afternoon to update the public about Hurricane Sandy, urging residents to stay off the roads and asking communities to close schools.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"Soon the entire commonwealth will feel the effects of the hurricane," Patrick said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>The National Weather Service reports that New England will likely see damaging winds, major flooding and beach erosion.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"To help keep the roads clear for emergency personnel and to keep  people safe from flying limbs and debris or from down power lines, I am  first of all requesting all schools including colleges and early  education programs to close Monday, for the safety of students and  employees alike," Patrick said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Patrick said all non-emergency state workers are asked to stay home Monday, and all state office buildings will be closed.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"And I am encouraging private employers to follow our lead and have their workers stay home as well," Patrick said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency Director Kurt Schwartz said coastal communities are in danger of severe coastal flooding and some may need to be evacuated.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"We have urged the coastal communities to carefully evaluate the  storm surge that is being predicted and to map out those areas of their  communities that are at risk of flooding and to take appropriate action  including notifying residents of those areas, businesses of those areas,  and if necessary to impose voluntary or mandatory evacuation areas," Schwartz said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Schwartz  pointed out the south shore, particularly in the New Bedford area and Buzzard's Bay, which  may see a storm surge of up to 10 feet. Other areas along the coast may  see storm surges of up to 6 feet. There will likely be pockets of severe flooding in many coastal communities.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Widespread power outages are likely, and Patrick said there may be an  even bigger impact on service than the state had during Hurricane Irene  last year.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Patrick emphasized the need for community cooperation during and after the storm, especially regarding keeping the roads clear and staying updated on conditions.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"We're going get through this," Patrick said. "We are as well prepared as we possibly can be."</p>

    </p><p>Federal emergency management and weather officials said Sunday that the time to prepare for Hurricane Sandy is rapidly coming to an end.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"The time for preparing and talking is about over," said Craig Fugate, adminstrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. People need to be acting about now."</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Hurricane Sandy is expected to affect as many as 50 million people as it makes its westward turn toward the East Coast.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>While the most recent maps show the center of the storm tracking toward New Jersey, forecasters are hesitant to pinpoint a specific area for landfall.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Rick Knabb, director of the National Hurricane Center, said forecasters are still looking for the storm to come ashore somewhere between the Delmarva coastline and Rhode Island.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Knabb cautioned the public not to focus on the track of the center of the storm or that it is a category one hurricane.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"I don't want folks to focus on the time of arrival because conditions are already starting to go down hill in coastal areas," said Knabb. "The system is large and of long duration...it could be a two-day event in many locations including inland locations."</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Heavy winds are expected from the Carolinas to New England through the middle of the week. Those winds are expected to cause massive power outages. One estimate from Johns Hopkins University places the number of <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2farbutus.patch.com%2farticles%2f10-million-may-lose-power-in-storm">estimated outages at 10 million</a> along the Mid-Atlantic to New England.</p><p>&#13;

    </p><p>Storm and tidal surges will combine along the coast and could produce flooding as much as 11 feet above ground level.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Knabb said forecasters predict <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ftowson.patch.com%2farticles%2fstorm-surge-inland-flooding-expected-from-sandy">inland flooding will become a problem</a> early on during the storm especially in Maryland and Pennsylvania.

                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; The Republican and Democratic candidates for New Hampshire governor are using a tried and true strategy in their campaigns: Frame their opponent&rsquo;s views on issues.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Republican gubernatorial candidate Ovide Lamontagne is using a reliable GOP election strategy of trying to pin a tax-and-spend, liberal Democrat label on rival Maggie Hassan.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Lamontagne points to state budgets Hassan helped write as a state senator that contained tax and fee hikes as proof voters can expect more of the same if she&rsquo;s elected. Lamontagne insists voters can&rsquo;t trust Hassan&rsquo;s word to veto a personal income or general sales tax.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Hassan is adopting a common Democratic strategy by portraying Lamontagne as an extremist with tea party ties who would take away the rights of women to make health care decisions and the rights of gays to marry.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Hassan said Lamontagne is deceiving voters by not discussing social issues or including his staunch opposition to abortion and gay marriage on his campaign website.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;The narratives fit in with the national narratives of the two parties,&rsquo;&rsquo; said political analyst Dean Spiliotes, who writes for NHPoliticalCapital.com.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Republican Party candidates argue Democrats will raise taxes and spend money, he said. Democratic Party candidates say GOP rivals are linked to the tea party and too socially conservative.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Trying to cement his point with voters, Lamontagne&rsquo;s campaign issues daily releases titled &lsquo;&lsquo;Maggie&rsquo;s Taxes of the Day&rsquo;&rsquo; with a list of fees or taxes in budgets passed when Hassan was in the Senate.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In response, Hassan has repeated her promise to veto a personal income or general sales tax. She focuses on how the budgets she worked on were balanced without enacting either tax.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;We balanced the budget and left a surplus,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Hassan offers very few examples of revenue measures she would support to produce a balanced budget if elected. She would reinstate a 10 cent-per-pack cut in the cigarette tax made by the Republican Legislature and beef up the auditing division to boost business tax receipts &mdash; another area the GOP cut.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Lamontagne contrasts Hassan&rsquo;s openness to those revenue measures with his vow not to raise any taxes and to find places in the budget to cut to offset proposed business tax cuts and spending increases. Hassan points out he has not said what he would cut to pay for millions of dollars in revenue cutting or spending proposals.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Both support a high-end casino near the Massachusetts border.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In fact, Republican and Democratic legislatures commonly used a variety of small tax and fee hikes over the years to balance budgets. That changed with the current conservative Republican Legislature, which did not raise taxes and instead made deep cuts, particularly in aid to hospitals and public colleges.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In attempting to frame Lamontagne for voters, Hassan points to his record running for the U.S. Senate in 2010 when he proudly campaigned on his conservative positions.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>She also tries to tie Lamontagne to the conservative group Cornerstone and its legislative agenda, which the group says it expects pledge signers to support. Lamontagne has signed the group&rsquo;s Families First Pledge, which includes bills to limit abortion, allow companies to deny a service to customers if it violates business owners&rsquo; religious beliefs, repeal New Hampshire&rsquo;s gay marriage law and create a religious exemption to contraceptive coverage in health policies.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Lamontagne signed the pledge that in general supports those principles, but he insists that though he supports conservative principles, he has not read Cornerstone&rsquo;s legislative agenda.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Those issues are not central to this election. This election is about jobs and the economy,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;&lsquo;Social issues are not foremost on people&rsquo;s minds.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>As governor, Lamontagne said he would lack the power to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court decision that makes abortion legal anyway, he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Hassan says his dismissal of social issues is disingenuous since conservative lawmakers already have filed bills to limit access to abortions that the next governor could find on his or her desk. Legislation to repeal gay marriage also is expected to be filed. She insists it is a mistake to try to separate social issues from a discussion on jobs and the economy.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know a woman in New Hampshire who believes that if she has to pay more for health care it is a social issue,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;&lsquo;If people who want to get married can&rsquo;t get married, that&rsquo;s an economic issue.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Andy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, said Hassan&rsquo;s strategy is the tougher sell because &mdash; with so much attention focused on the presidential race &mdash; it is harder to get voters&rsquo; attention. Lamontagne has an easier time playing to voters&rsquo; anti-tax sentiment because of the state&rsquo;s long history of opposing income and sales taxes, he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;The argument Maggie is making is largely to the Democratic base, to people who would vote Democratic anyway,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.<img alt="end of story marker" border="0" height="8" width="6" src="http://www.boston.com/r/SysConfig/WebPortal/Boston/Framework/images/site_graphics/dingbat_story_end_icon.gif" class="storyend"></p>

  content: "<div><div><p>Dr. Edward (Ned) Shilling Hodgson, of Concord, a renowned neurophysiologist who was the first to record electrical signals from a single cell, established fundamental principles of taste, and later determined how sharks find and attack humans in the sea through smell, has died following a brief illness on October 22. He was 85. \xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Born in Wilmington, Delaware, on October 28, 1926 Hodgson developed an early interest in biology and music, studying piano with Percy Grainger. As a graduate student at Johns Hopkins working with Vincent Detheir, he wanted to understand how animals\xE2\x80\x99 nerves can detect taste. He refined the skills needed to make his own glass electrodes and became a microsurgeon in order to record nerve impulses from microscopic taste receptor cells in houseflies.\xC2\xA0 Because the cells were so small, he placed one cell inside a homemade glass electrode to make the recording resulting in a classic 1951 paper in Science. During later work at Columbia and Tufts Universities in the 1950s and 1960s, he discovered that inhibition or blocking of nerve transmission is a fundamental feature of how the nervous system works and can determine animal behavior.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In the late 1960s, Hodgson was asked by the US Navy to help them determine how sharks locate wounded soldiers lost at sea after battles. During the Battle of the Coral sea hundreds of military personnel were believed to have been eaten by sharks. Hodgson established a research program at the Lerner Marine Laboratory in Bimini, Bahamas and was able to determine the important role that sight, sound, smell and electrical signals from specialized organs located under the snout of sharks, play in allowing sharks to locate prey in the water.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>While a Professor and later Chair of Biology at Tufts University, Hodgson was one of the first to take university biology students out to sea and introduce them to marine biology through \xE2\x80\x9Cimmersion learning.\xE2\x80\x9D \xC2\xA0This led to a new research path into coral reef science.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>His wife of 54 years, Valorie Simpson Hodgson, also a marine biologist, passed away in 2003. Hodgson is survived by two sons, Karl of Eagan, MN and Gregor of Calabasas, CA and three grandchildren Cara, Tasha and Richard.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>A memorial service will be held at Tufts University at a time and date to be announced.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Donations in lieu of flowers can be made to the Reef Check Foundation, P.O. Box 1057, Pacific Palisades, CA 90272.\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.reefcheck.org\">www.reefcheck.org</a></p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>This week's <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexington.patch.com%2fcolumns%2fhome-of-the-week-3c52df2c">Lexington Home of the Week</a>, is well, not one home, but three. This breathtaking land, locally known as the Otis Emery Mulliken Property, was divided into three condominium homes in the 1980s: the main house into two units and the barn. The current owners of all three units initially bought number 221 and eventually as the other two residences became available, purchased all three with the intention of converting the main house into one large residence. Now relocating, they are pleased to offer this distinctive prospect to another fortunate owner.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>As visitors travel up a long, circular drive, they are greeted by a beautiful estate majestically resting on a lush, private one and a half acre knoll. A magnificent 43-foot front porch awaits as a fitting introduction and the perfect setting to view the celebrated historic oak tree that has been proudly standing since the revolutionary war.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>The handsome period entrance with a double sets of leaded doors lends a hint as to what awaits inside of Unit 1. The long, gracious foyer leads to a formal living room with original built-ins, a carved fireplace and sun drenched solarium. The banquet-sized dining area offers a bay of oversized windows and opens into a state-of-the-art kitchen with granite surfaces and stainless steel appliances. A gracious staircase leads to the second level which includes three bedrooms, including a master suite with a walk-in closet and a full, private bath and an office with a spectacular leaded glass entrance.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Unit 2 offers a private entrance on the left side of the main house and boasts a sophisticated four-bedroom residence among three levels. The first floor offers a bright, eat-in kitchen, dining area, charming fireplaced living room and a bedroom and full bath for residents who prefer or require single-floor living. Two bedrooms and a full bath are located on the second level and another bedroom, full bath and large study on the third story.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Unit 3, the barn, somehow manages to convey a dramatic statement yet still retains its rustic charm. This four-story structure boasts exquisite details, including soaring beamed ceilings, sliding barn doors and incredibly elegant spaces. Its open floor plan is large enough for fluid entertaining with a soapstone and stainless steel kitchen opening into an airy dining area and the barn door can even be opened for refreshing alfresco dining. There is a first floor bedroom and bath on this level as well as a separate one-bedroom apartment. The second level includes three bedrooms, two full baths, a large balcony and sitting area and the third story studio flaunts amazing built-ins for storage.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>This magnificent property is located in the center of Lexington, but residents will feel as if they are in an enchanting world of their own. The grounds and resourceful site and egresses for all three units allow privacy for all so this estate would make an excellent real estate investment or the ideal solution for extended families. This is an incredibly unique opportunity to obtain and experience a significant slice of Lexington's legendary history.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Location:</strong> 221-225 Waltham St.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $2.8 million</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Units on Property:</strong> 3</p><p>&#13;

  title: Benn challenges Atkins for state representative

    <p>State Representative Cory Atkins,&nbsp;a Concord Democrat who believes the state is doing a lot of things right, is seeking a seventh term in a race against Republican challenger Michael J. Benn,&nbsp;who says the one-party control on Beacon Hill has government &ldquo;out of balance.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Atkins, 65, and Benn, 47, are vying to represent the 14th Middlesex District, which covers all of Concord and Carlisle, and parts of Acton and Chelmsford.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Benn, who grew up in Concord, has served on the town&rsquo;s Public Ceremonies and Celebrations Committee,&nbsp;is active in the Knights of Columbus and in his church, where he taught Catholic religious education, and spent time coaching his children&rsquo;s youth soccer teams.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>After graduating from Northeastern University and earning a master&rsquo;s degree in business administration from Boston University, he spent his career working in health care finance, Benn said. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a total product of the private sector,&rdquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Benn said he views government from the perspectives of a parent, student, taxpayer, and someone who has worked in business for 24 years.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;These are the customers of government, and the customer should always be right,&rdquo; he said, adding that state government has lost sight of this.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Benn said the primary reason he&rsquo;s running is to get those who are &ldquo;stuck in the unemployment cycle&rdquo; back to work and to boost the economy. <span>&ldquo;These are real people with real needs who need good food on their plate and a good roof over their head,&rdquo; he said.</span>
    
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Bringing the state income tax rate and sales tax back down to 5 percent is a good starting point in restoring a thriving state economy, he said.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>He emphasized that he does not advocate for a lower tax rate to simply &ldquo;put a few more dollars in my pocket,&rdquo; but to provide the economic stimulus necessary for small businesses to thrive and create jobs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Many people who live near the New Hampshire border, and many from the 14th Middlesex District, drive over the state line to avoid the 6&frac14; percent sales tax in Massachusetts.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;When that happens, the state loses revenue from the whole sale,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Businesses lose sales and unemployment goes up.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The second thing on Benn&rsquo;s economic agenda is to get spending under control.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Legislators should take the same approach to creating a budget as people in the private sector, which is to start at zero and require those requesting funds to justify each dollar being asked for, Benn said. 
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;We all maybe do more than we would have liked to do with less money than we would have liked to do it with,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But the job gets done.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Benn said if legislators worked together on Beacon Hill as well as individuals do in the private sector, things in government would get done more efficiently. &ldquo;But some people are doing things for their own political gain,&rdquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Atkins, who was first elected to Beacon Hill in a special election in 1999, said the state&rsquo;s economy is a lot better than in many parts of the country.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;Our bond rating is double A plus, one of only three states with that rating, we are ranked first in education .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and our rainy day fund is over $1 billion,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That gives us a real advantage in attracting business and creating jobs.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Atkins said that while the state has an innovative economy, it also has a cold climate, which can be a turnoff for companies looking for a place to locate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;But what attracts businesses here is our quality of life and our education system,&rdquo; she said.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>She said legislation passed during the last session, including health care cost containment, a jobs bill, and a move to streamline the permitting process for companies to build here, will help spur growth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>But another key issue, Atkins said, is public transportation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>She said the approximately $20 billion deficit in that department is something that can no longer be pushed aside, and balancing the budget &ldquo;is going to take a large, dedicated revenue stream.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>She said her first priority will be to make sure the concerns of the people in her district are represented, but that she is not ruling out voting in favor of a tax increase or new revenue stream that would specifically be used to balance the transportation budget.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a grown-up,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Santa Claus is not going to appear and fix this. I wish he were, but we are going to have to fix this and we are going to have to pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Another thing Atkins says needs fixing is campaign finance laws that allow companies to pour unlimited amounts of money directly into political advertisements.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="">
    <p>Atkins sponsored legislation calling for lawmakers in Washington to respond to a US Supreme Court ruling that allows for the unfettered corporate contributions.

  content: "<div><div><p><i>Energizer</i>\xC2\xA0and International Association of Fire Chiefs Honor Silver Anniversary with Adoption of 25 Fire Departments and Donation of 250,000 Batteries across the Country</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The message is simple, and the habit can be lifesaving. Thirty-eight percent of fatal fire injuries occur in homes without working smoke alarms, while 24 percent occur in homes in which at least one smoke alarm is present but fails to operate, frequently due to dead or missing batteries.* For 25 years, the\xC2\xA0<i>Change Your Clock Change Your Battery</i><sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>program has been dedicated to helping share the life-saving reminder to change the batteries in your home\xE2\x80\x99s smoke and carbon monoxide detectors when you change your clocks for daylight savings.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>This year,\xC2\xA0<i>Energizer</i>\xC2\xA0and the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC) will mark the silver anniversary of one of the nation\xE2\x80\x99s top home fire safety programs by donating 250,000<i>Energizer<sub>\xC2\xAE</sub></i>\xC2\xA0MAX<sub>\xC2\xAE\xC2\xA0</sub>batteries to fire departments across the country to distribute to local families in their areas and adopting 25 fire departments in 25 cities across the nation, who, in addition to batteries, will be equipped with a variety<i>Energizer</i><sub>\xC2\xAE</sub>\xC2\xA0family safety products for their department and to share in their communities. Together, they will host Home Safety Days and neighborhood canvasses spanning throughout National Fire Prevention Month in October until the end of daylight saving time on Sunday, Nov. 4.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CIn the past 25 years, the number of home fire deaths has substantially decreased,\xE2\x80\x9D said Chief Hank Clemmensen, IAFC president and chairman of the board. \xE2\x80\x9CThat success is mostly thanks to the thousands of hours\xE2\x80\x94every year for 25 years\xE2\x80\x94that local fire departments have dedicated to improving the safety environment through technology, policy and, especially, public education efforts like the\xC2\xA0<i>Change Your Clock Change Your Battery<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>\xC2\xA0</i>program. But the world does not stand still, local fire department budgets are shrinking, many people still don\xE2\x80\x99t have a basic baseline of protection from smoke alarms, and we must keep pace with changes in technology and the built environment, It\xE2\x80\x99s still vital that homes be equipped with working smoke detectors in order to give families those critical extra seconds to escape.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>There are currently 23 million homes at risk of a fire because\xE2\x80\x94although they have smoke alarms\xE2\x80\x94the alarms are not functioning, mostly due to dead or missing batteries. Sharing the reminder to Change Your Clock Change Your Battery<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>\xC2\xA0is a simple way to help protect neighbors and loved ones. \xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CWe began the\xC2\xA0<i>Change Your Clock Change Your Battery</i><sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>program with the IAFC 25 years ago to do our part in helping to keep families safe, \xE2\x80\x9Csaid Michelle Atkinson, Vice President of Marketing for\xC2\xA0<i>Energizer</i>\xC2\xA0North America. \xE2\x80\x9CToday it\xE2\x80\x99s amazing to look back and see how the more than four million batteries donated through hundreds of neighborhood canvasses has translated to countless lives being saved. It\xE2\x80\x99s another example of our philosophy of\xC2\xA0<i>that\xE2\x80\x99s positivenergy</i><sub>\xE2\x84\xA2</sub>\xC2\xA0brought to life. We are grateful to the IAFC and local fire departments across the country for helping us share this message and make a positive impact.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The 25<sup>th</sup>\xC2\xA0anniversary of Change Your Clock Change Your Battery<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>\xC2\xA0kicked off Oct. 1 in Chicago, where the Chicago Fire Department was joined by MLB Hall of Famer and\xC2\xA0<i>that\xE2\x80\x99s positivenergy</i><sub>\xE2\x84\xA2</sub>\xC2\xA0Ambassador Cal Ripken, Jr. to honor the anniversary of the Great Chicago Fire. The Energizer Bunny<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>Brigade recreated the scene of the O\xE2\x80\x99Leary Barn, where by legend the fire started, and firefighters provided a fire safety demonstration for local students. Following, Ripken led the first of the neighborhood canvasses with fire officials in Southside Chicago who conducted fire safety inspections and surprised homeowners with Family Safety Kits, stocked with products designed to help keep homes safe including Kidde smoke detectors,\xC2\xA0<i>Energizer</i><sub>\xC2\xAE\xC2\xA0</sub>MAX<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>\xC2\xA0batteries and\xC2\xA0<i>Energizer</i><sub>\xC2\xAE</sub>Weatheready<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>\xC2\xA0flashlights.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The<i>\xC2\xA0Change Your Clock Change Your Battery<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup></i><sup>\xC2\xA0</sup>program is just one of the ways\xC2\xA0<i>Energizer</i>\xC2\xA0brings to life the company\xE2\x80\x99s commitment to making a positive impact in communities across the country.\xC2\xA0<i>that\xE2\x80\x99s positivenergy<sub>\xE2\x84\xA2</sub></i></p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>As Hurricane Sandy barrels toward the East Coast, Gov. Deval Patrick held another press conference Sunday afternoon to update the public about Hurricane Sandy, urging residents to stay off the roads and asking communities to close schools.</p><p>&#13;

    </p><p>The National Weather Service reports that New England will likely see damaging winds, major flooding and beach erosion.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"To help keep the roads clear for emergency personnel and to keep  people safe from flying limbs and debris or from down power lines, I am  first of all requesting all schools including colleges and early  education programs to close Monday, for the safety of students and  employees alike," Patrick said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Patrick said all non-emergency state workers are asked to stay home Monday, and all state office buildings will be closed.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"And I am encouraging private employers to follow our lead and have their workers stay home as well," Patrick said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency Director Kurt Schwartz said coastal communities are in danger of severe coastal flooding and some may need to be evacuated.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"We have urged the coastal communities to carefully evaluate the  storm surge that is being predicted and to map out those areas of their  communities that are at risk of flooding and to take appropriate action  including notifying residents of those areas, businesses of those areas,  and if necessary to impose voluntary or mandatory evacuation areas," Schwartz said.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Schwartz  pointed out the south shore, particularly in the New Bedford area and Buzzard's Bay, which  may see a storm surge of up to 10 feet. Other areas along the coast may  see storm surges of up to 6 feet. There will likely be pockets of severe flooding in many coastal communities.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Widespread power outages are likely, and Patrick said there may be an  even bigger impact on service than the state had during Hurricane Irene  last year.</p><p>&#13;

  community_id: "30"
  url: http://pubapi.outside.in/r?url=http://feeds.boston.com/click.phdo?i%3D2903006e7407b76655002f09a1dce337&publication_id=0&placement=list&region_name=Lexington_MA
  content: "<div><div>\r\n\
    \t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"byline\"><p class=\"byline\">By Chelsea Conaboy, Globe Staff</p></p>\r\n\
    \t\t\t\t\t<p>Dr. Ben Warf thought the prospects were poor that Ugandan children with hydrocephalus, or an excess of water on the brain, could be successfully treated by implanting a drainage tube. Families he cared for at a Mbale hospital had limited access to health care. A blockage in the tube, called a shunt, could be disastrous. </p>\n\
    <p>In the early 2000s, Warf devised an alternative that reduced the number of infants who needed brain shunts by about two-thirds. It became the standard of care at Boston Children\xE2\x80\x99s Hospital, where he directs the Neonatal and Congenital Anomaly Neurosurgery Program. Now Warf is unraveling the causes of hydrocephalus, work he hopes could lead to prevention. </p>\n\
    <p>The 54-year-old from Lexington has been named a 2012 MacArthur Foundation Fellow, one of four Boston-area recipients of the \xE2\x80\x9Cgenius grant.\xE2\x80\x9D The award comes with a $500,000 stipend and, for Warf, visibility for a global health problem that he said has been \xE2\x80\x9Cway under the radar.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\
    <p>Warf grew up in the Appalachian Mountains of Eastern Kentucky, the son of a Southern Baptist pastor with a strong interest in science. He graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1984 and was drawn to pediatric neurosurgery in part by his love of children. He and his wife, Cindy, have six of their own. </p>\n\
    <p>The pair decided in early 2000 to act on Warf\xE2\x80\x99s longtime dream of being a medical missionary. He had made some short trips to Kenya with CURE International, a Christian organization that provides surgical care in developing nations, and in March of that year the couple moved their family to Uganda, where he would help to open a hospital specializing in neurosurgery. </p>\n\
    <p>With high rates of childbirth, little perinatal care, and even less access to surgical specialists, Warf found the demand for his skills was high. \xE2\x80\x9CImmediately, it became obvious that we were going to be very busy,\xE2\x80\x9D he said.</p>\n\
    <p>Cindy Warf said her husband worried about leaving academic medicine in the United States. He thought he would have to leave his love of research behind. Instead, he found the focus of his professional life.</p>\n\
    <p>Warf was unhappy with placing shunts in Ugandan patients. In the United States, about half of shunts fail within two years, and some children endure scores of operations. </p>\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CWe felt hard-pressed to try to avoid shunt dependence,\xE2\x80\x9D Warf said.</p>\n\
    <p>Warf tested a combination of techniques that alone had been mostly ineffective in treating infants with hydrocephalus. He cauterized tissues in the brain to slow the production of fluid and made small openings in the base of the brain to allow fluid to drain into the cavity around it. Warf and colleagues followed patients over time and <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2fpubmed%2f22044377\">found the method was effective</a>. </p>\n\
    <p>Researchers have estimated that about three of every 1,000 children born in sub-Saharan Africa develop hydrocephalus after an infection. Ward knew that was the primary cause in his patients. He collected fluid samples that were tested at Pennsylvania State University and found to include bacterial DNA.   </p>\n\
    <p>When researchers overlaid data Warf had collected with weather patterns for the region, they found that the incidence of infection rose and fell with changes in rainfall, pointing to an environmental pathogen. </p>\n\
    <p>Now Warf and colleagues are partnering with a hospital and medical school in western Uganda to follow mothers and babies from birth to six months of age to learn more about those who develop hydrocephalus. </p>\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CThere\xE2\x80\x99s a lot that we don\xE2\x80\x99t know,\xE2\x80\x9D he said.</p>\n\
    <p>With funding from CURE, Warf has trained 20 neurosurgeons, mostly in Africa. They were outfitted with laptops to track their work. Warf hopes their data will provide a more global look at the condition and the various pathogens that could cause it. </p>\n\
    <p>The MacArthur award will further that goal, he said, allowing him to spend more time in Africa and on research projects based in the United States. </p>\r\n\

  summary: Dr. Ben Warf thought the prospects were poor that Ugandan children with hydrocephalus, or an excess of water on the brain, could be successfully treated by implanting a drainage tube. So, in the early 2000s, Warf devised an alternative that reduced the number of infants who needed shunts by about tw

    <p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><em>At Patch we're always trying to pull together into one place all of the best local resources on every topic, including books and reading, and we have the good fortune to be working with a best-selling author James Patterson in this endeavor, and we'll be sharing his reading list selections for every age here on Patch. Plus, we'll showcase reading lists from our local librarians, bookstores, and you\xE2\x80\x94our readers. But here, an open letter to moms and dads of reluctant readers from James Patterson.</em></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Dear Moms and Dads,</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>I\xE2\x80\x99ve had the good fortune to meet hundreds of teachers and librarians around the country. They always wow me with their tips and tricks to get kids into reading. I thought it was time to get these great ideas out in the open so you all can use them at home.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>So, we asked teachers and librarians to send us their ways for successfully turning reluctant kids into hooked readers. There are many methods, but, interesting to me, is that there are a half dozen overarching ones from which to work. Go ahead \xE2\x80\x94 give these a shot at home with your kids:</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\xA2 After a kid has read a book, listen\xE2\x80\x94really listen\xE2\x80\x94to what he has to say about it. Show him that his opinions matter and that you respect his judgment.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\xA2 Make books \xE2\x80\x94 lots of them \xE2\x80\x94 available. Go the library. Go to book sales. Go to bookstores.\xC2\xA0Give your kiddo many books you\xE2\x80\x99ve selected especially for him to choose from.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\xA2 Reward reading. With prizes, with privileges, with praise.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\xA2 Set the rules and expectations \xE2\x80\x94 how much time, how many books. Your children will rise to your expectations.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\xA2 However old they are, read to your children or read with them. Talk about the books you\xE2\x80\x99re sharing chapter-by-chapter so that you are both responsible to keep the conversation going.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\xA2 New habits are too easy to break. Don\xE2\x80\x99t stop any of this when your kids become those avid readers. They need your consistent support.</p><p>&#13;\n\

  title: Kent State proud of football success, but shift focus to arch-rival Akron
  community_id: "31"
  url: http://pubapi.outside.in/r?url=http://www.recordpub.com/news/sports_article/5225243&publication_id=0&placement=list&region_name=Akron_OH
  content: <div><p><p><span>Allen Moff | Staff Writer</span></p> <p><span>It&rsquo;s been 39 years since it&rsquo;s felt this good to be a member of the Kent State football program.</span></p> <p><span>The Golden Flashes are still being showered with praise and accolades following Saturday&rsquo;s stunningly decisive 35-23 victory over No. 18 Rutgers &mdash; and deservedly so. Kent State is 7-1 for the first time since 1973, has won six straight games for the first time since 1940, and sits all alone atop the Mid-American Conference East Division standings at 4-0 with four league games remaining.</span></p> <p><span>On Monday, head coach Darrell Hazell and his Flashes were beaming with pride over Saturday&rsquo;s performance in Piscataway, N.J.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;That was a great game. It was a great environment, and our kids were hitting on all cylinders,&rdquo; said Hazell. &ldquo;It was just a lot of fun to be out there and feel the energy from the players, from the sidelines, walking up the tunnel after halftime, just all the energy that was being provided by our guys. That&rsquo;s probably the best from start to finish energy-wise and confidence-wise that our team showed since we&rsquo;ve been here. It was a lot of fun.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><span>But one word immediately wiped all the smiles off their faces during Monday&rsquo;s press conference.</span></p> <p><span>Akron.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s pretty pumped up, but now we just gotta keep it going,&rdquo; said KSU junior defensive end Mark Fackler. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t celebrate. We gotta get ready for Akron now.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><span>The Flashes will meet their struggling rival on Saturday at Dix Stadium (2 p.m.), a matchup that makes putting the Rutgers victory behind them all the easier.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;I really like the fact that our guys came off last week and the first thing on their mind (Sunday) at the team meeting was, it&rsquo;s (Akron) time,&rdquo; said Hazell.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;This is what we&rsquo;ve waited on. A rivalry game, it&rsquo;s a 365-day commitment. You do all of those things in the off-season because of this week, this one day. One team will be able to walk around for 365 days prideful, and the other one has to walk differently.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very important game, and we let that be known.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><span>The two rivals are currently heading in opposite directions, with Kent State riding a seven-game winning streak while the Zips (1-8, 0-5) have just one win on the season and have dropped six in a row. Still, Hazell isn&rsquo;t worried one bit about his Flashes overlooking Akron.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no concern of a letdown,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This team is very mature. They prepare very hard every week, and each contest is its own entity. I&rsquo;m very confident that our guys will prepare hard for this game.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;Obviously it&rsquo;s a throw-out-the-records game. When you&rsquo;re playing in any type of rivalry, you better play as hard as you possibly can play.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><strong>HOW TO BEAT A RIVAL</strong></p> <p><span>Hazell knows plenty about how to succeed in rivalries, after helping Ohio State go 7-0 against Michigan in his seven years as an assistant coach with the Buckeyes (2004-10) under Jim Tressel.</span></p> <p><span>Does he put some of the lessons he learned about rivalries from Tressel to use?</span></p> <p><span>Absolutely,&rdquo; said Hazell.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some things practice-wise that we&rsquo;ll do this week that we did at my last job. Not so much schematic things, just preparation-wise and some of the mindset things that you have to have when you&rsquo;re going into a rivalry.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><span>Hazell&rsquo;s Flashes defeated Akron 35-3 in his first season as head coach last year. Kent State has won the last two matchups with the Zips, and will seek its first three-game winning streak in the rivalry since 1952-54.</span></p> <p><strong>BOOTS APLENTY</strong></p> <p><span>Although the Flashes managed to escape Rutgers virtually injury-free, three star players will be wearing walking boots once again this week &mdash; junior speedster Dri Archer, senior kicker Freddy Cortez and junior defensive tackle Roosevelt Nix.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gotta lot of boots right now throughout the course of the week,&rdquo; said Hazell. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all precautionary, so they don&rsquo;t stress that part of the ankle. They&rsquo;ll all be ready to go.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><span>Cortez injured an ankle last week, then was hit by a Scarlet Knights defender while kicking an extra point on Saturday.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;Freddy&rsquo;s a little bit bumped up, but he&rsquo;ll be fine by Saturday,&rdquo; said Hazell. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll rest him for a couple days, and he&rsquo;ll be ready to go.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><span>Hazell used Cortez as an example of his team&rsquo;s vastly improved overall toughness.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a lot of guys that are get-back-in guys, where a year ago at the beginning part of the season a guy would get nicked up, and he&rsquo;d look for a way to stay on the sideline,&rdquo; said Hazell. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got guys on the team now, they come hobbling off and before you know it they&rsquo;re trying to get back in the football game. That speaks to their toughness, it speaks to how important the team is, it speaks to just the importance of everything that&rsquo;s going on in this program right now. Freddy is one of those guys. After they ran into him on one of those extra points, I told (assistant coach Jafar) Williams to have (punter Anthony) Melchiori kick the kickoff. Coach Williams comes running down the sidelines and says Freddy wants to kickoff. I said let him.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;You look at the little things throughout the course of your program and where you&rsquo;re getting a little bit more improvement, and that&rsquo;s one of those things. That&rsquo;s why I like this football team so much. It&rsquo;s nice to be around.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><strong>PRAISE FOR DURHAM</strong></p> <p><span>Hazell heaped praise on sophomore running back Trayion Durham for his performance against the Scarlet Knights. Even though he fumbled twice, with the second drop coming after a long run in the fourth quarter when Kent State was on the verge of putting the game away.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;I think he was a little bit loose with the ball on both of those, the ball was out a little bit,&rdquo; said Hazell. &ldquo;Especially in the last situation, we can&rsquo;t put the ball on the ground. He makes a great run and the guy gets him from the side. He should have rolled that thing high and tight on that last one.&rdquo;</span></p> <p><span>Aside from the fumbles, Durham rushed 22 times for a career-high 131 yards and a touchdown against a Rutgers defense that had not allowed a 100-yard rusher this season.</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;The impressive thing about Trayion is that he&rsquo;s getting better each week, and he&rsquo;s hungrier each week to get better,&rdquo; said Hazell. &ldquo;He and I had a text exchange (Sunday). I said I thought this is the hardest you&rsquo;ve run since you&rsquo;ve been here. I thought your pads were going in the right direction, I thought you were good in the hole. And his response back to me was, &lsquo;coach, I gotta play a lot better.&rsquo;</span></p> <p><span>&ldquo;It was great to see that response,&rdquo; Hazell said</span></p><p><strong>MAC HONORS BATTON</strong></p> <p><span>Senior linebacker Luke Batton was named MAC East Division Defensive Player of the Week after recording seven tackles, a sack, an interception and tipping a pass that was intercepted against Rutgers. If the MAC had a Defensive Player of the Month it would have to be Batton, who compiled 47 tackles, two fumble recoveries &mdash; one of which he returned 83 yards for a touchdown &mdash; two interceptions and two deflected passes that were picked off by teammates in four games during October.</span></p></p></div>
  summary: It's been 39 years since it's felt this good to be a member of the Kent State football program.

    <p>&#13;
    </p><p>Federal emergency management and weather officials said Sunday that the time to prepare for Hurricane Sandy is rapidly coming to an end.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"The time for preparing and talking is about over," said Craig Fugate, adminstrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. People need to be acting about now."</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Hurricane Sandy is expected to affect as many as 50 million people as it makes its westward turn toward the East Coast.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>While the most recent maps show the center of the storm tracking toward New Jersey, forecasters are hesitant to pinpoint a specific area for landfall.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Rick Knabb, director of the National Hurricane Center, said forecasters are still looking for the storm to come ashore somewhere between the Delmarva coastline and Rhode Island.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Knabb cautioned the public not to focus on the track of the center of the storm or that it is a category one hurricane.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>"I don't want folks to focus on the time of arrival because conditions are already starting to go down hill in coastal areas," said Knabb. "The system is large and of long duration...it could be a two-day event in many locations including inland locations."</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Heavy winds are expected from the Carolinas to New England through the middle of the week. Those winds are expected to cause massive power outages. One estimate from Johns Hopkins University places the number of <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2farbutus.patch.com%2farticles%2f10-million-may-lose-power-in-storm">estimated outages at 10 million</a> along the Mid-Atlantic to New England.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>In Maryland, <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ftowson.patch.com%2farticles%2fabout-2-000-out-of-state-utility-workers-recruited-for-storm-recovery-efforts">BGE</a> and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fgermantown.patch.com%2farticles%2fpepco-bge-prepare-for-hurricane-sandy">PEPCO</a> have brought in crews from as far away as New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Storm and tidal surges will combine along the coast and could produce flooding as much as 11 feet above ground level.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Knabb said forecasters predict <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ftowson.patch.com%2farticles%2fstorm-surge-inland-flooding-expected-from-sandy">inland flooding will become a problem</a> early on during the storm especially in Maryland and Pennsylvania. He added on Sunday morning that flooding could also be a problem in places like upstate New York and southern portions of Massachusettes.</p>

This recipe comes from entertaining guru and regular <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ftoday.msnbc.msn.com%2f\">Today Show</a> contributor <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.jeannebenedict.com%2frecipes%2fmar-gore-ita-with-lime-wheel-eyeball-from-jeanne-benedicts-halloween-cocktail-today-show-appearance%2f\">Jeanne Benedict</a> (who also happens to be a high school friend of mine!).</i></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>Ingredients/Directions for Margaritas:</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ul><li>1 1/2 oz. Tequila </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>1/2 oz. triple sec </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>2 oz. sweet and sour mix</li>&#13;\n\
    </ul><p>Combine ingredients over ice in prepared red caramel blood-dripped Margarita glass with lime eye-ball garnish.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><b>Ingredients for Lime Wheel Eyeball:</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ul><li>Lime wheel (slice of lime)</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Red Maraschino cherry </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Mini chocolate chip </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>1-inch long piece of green plastic straw</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Red Caramel (see recipe below) </li>&#13;\n\
    </ul><p><b>Directions:</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ol><li>The day before the party, cut maraschino cherries in half and prep red caramel</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Use a dab of red caramel on back of mini chocolate chips and stick them in center of cherries to resemble a pupil. </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Dip ends of 1-inch straws in red caramel and insert into the open cut side of each Maraschino cherry half. (The cherry will look like a little umbrella with the straw as a handle. This will help keep the cherry in place on the lime as wet cherries do not stick to wet limes very well!) </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Set cherries on a piece of wax paper, and allow caramel to set up overnight.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>An hour before the party, cut a slit into the lime wheel and slip the straw with cherry on it into the slit and up to the center of the lime wheel as the iris of the eyeball. </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Slip the garnishes on the rims of the glasses. </li>&#13;\n\
    </ol><p><b>Red Caramel Blood Drips</b></p><p>&#13;\n\

    <li>1/2 cup light corn syrup </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>1/4 cup hot water </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>1/4 teaspoon red food coloring</li>&#13;\n\
    </ul><p><b>Directions:</b></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ol><li>To make the red caramel drips: Combine ingredients in a small saucepan and stir until sugar is moistened. </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Heat saucepan over medium-high heat until mixture reaches soft ball candy stage, about 4 to 6 minutes. </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Remove from heat and cool completely. </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Place Margarita glasses on wax paper. </li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Use the back of a spoon to scrape red caramel on the outside glass rims creating the blood drips. </li>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>The USDA emphasizes \"never to taste food to determine its safety\" and says that you should \"evaluate each item separately.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Generally, if the temperature in the thermometer in the freezer reads 40 degrees Fahrenheit or below, the food is safe and can be refrozen, according to the USDA.

    \t\t\t<p><span><em><strong>Covington and Tipp have had their share of early-round post-season frustrations, but a look around the state tells us that they have plenty of company.\xC2\xA0 The issue is&#8230;why?</strong></em></span></p>\n\
    <p><strong>Yogi (Berra) would say,</strong> &#8220;It&#8217;s like deja-vu all over again.&#8221;</p>\n\
    <p>In motion picture terms, it&#8217;s like a scene with Bill Murray from <em><strong>Groundhog Day</strong></em>.</p>\n\
    <p>A psychic might shake her head over it and say, &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to go there this weekend.&#8221;</p>\n\
    <p>What are we talking about?</p>\n\
    <p>The football playoffs open this weekend with as many as eleven area teams within twenty miles of Miami County (Covington, Bradford, Tippecanoe, Milton Union, Miami East, Minster, Ft. Loramie, Marion Local, Wayne, Trotwood and Tecumseh) awarded first-round games, hoping to advance toward that elusive date for the state finals in Massillon and Canton on the first weekend in December.</p>\n\
    <p>And while that opportunity seems wide open and positive three days out, the reality for some teams must seem like winning once you get there, in Biblical terms, is like putting a camel through the eye of a needle (Matt. 19:24).</p>\n\
    <p>The two most notables in that respect from Miami County would be Covington and Tippecanoe.</p>\n\
    <p>Since 1999 no Division VI \xC2\xA0team in southwest Ohio (or statewide) has a regular season winning percentage as high, or higher, than the Covington Buccaneers.\xC2\xA0 During that twenty three year period the Buccs have had perfect 10-0 seasons eight times, amassing an overall winning percentage of 85.8% (133-24).</p>\n\
    <p>Their post-season record, however, has been a different story.\xC2\xA0 In 23 games (Division V and VI) the Buccs are just 10-13. Five of those losses came in the first round to MAC opponents, Delphos St. John, Marion Local (twice), and Coldwater.\xC2\xA0 Another loss in 2007 came at the hands of the Lehman Cavaliers.</p>\n\
    <div id=\"attachment_19066\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpressprosmagazine.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2fhistorytellsus_inset2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-19066\" title=\"historytellsus_inset2\" src=\"http://pressprosmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/historytellsus_inset2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"367\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Coach Bret Pearce and the Milton Union Bulldogs return to the playoffs this weekend, but have never advanced beyond the regional round previously.</p></div>\n\
    <p>Likewise, few teams can rival the regular season consistency of the Tipp Red Devils during the past decade.\xC2\xA0 Not as good as Covington in terms of winning percentage, perhaps, but Charlie Burgbacher&#8217;s teams have nonetheless won better than 75% of their games against league opponents.\xC2\xA0 However, their post-season percentage for the same period, like Covington&#8217;s, is far short of that, having been\xC2\xA0knocked out consistently in the first round by teams like St. Marys, Clyde, and Turpin, who the Red Devils play this weekend as the #8 seed in the first round.</p>\n\
    <p>By the way, neither Covington and Tipp are alone with this ignominy.\xC2\xA0 Many teams from around the state can claim to be regular season goliaths, only to come up short against &#8220;more select&#8221; competition.\xC2\xA0 In Lawrence County, along the Ohio River, Division VI Symmes Valley and Coach Rusty Webb have been exemplary since 2000, but have never advanced to the regional round of the tournament.</p>\n\
    <p>Now\xC2\xA0we use quotation marks to emphasize the term &#8220;more select&#8221; for a reason.\xC2\xA0 For competition is what history tells us about the playoffs, painting a picture for teams like Covington.\xC2\xA0 For their\xC2\xA0sterling and deserved reputation as being the best in their league and one of the best small-school programs in the state,\xC2\xA0the Buccs have never been to Massillon, but did finish as runners-up to Mogadore High School in the 1979 championship game (then Class A) played in Akron&#8230;33 years ago.</p>\n\
    <p>It is important to note, too, that up until last year Covington&#8217;s classification was that of a Division VI school, playing in the smallest of the state&#8217;s six divisions.\xC2\xA0 Small schools mean, in most cases, a struggle to maintain as many as 30 boys in their football program, thereby often playing at a competitive disadvantage.\xC2\xA0 This has really hurt Covington in the past when paired against Division VI programs like Marion Local and Delphos, who regularly dress 75 and enjoy far better depth at every position on the field.</p>\n\
    <p>For that fact Covington simply does not see that kind of depth, or competition, in their affiliation as a member of the Cross County Conference.\xC2\xA0 Rarely does an opponent in that league dress 40, Miami East being the notable exception.\xC2\xA0 Covington dressed 42 this year when fully healthy.\xC2\xA0 The league average in the CCC is 34.</p>\n\
    <p>Likewise, Tipp has suffered from a competitive shortfall in the Central Buckeye Conference in recent years, but not from numbers.\xC2\xA0 Past perennial powers such as Bellefontaine, Graham and Urbana have fallen on leaner football fortunes, leaving only Springfield Shawnee and Tecumseh as competitive equals to the Red Devils, and both beat Tipp this year in head-to-head matchups during the season.</p>\n\
    <p>Now it doesn&#8217;t take a genius to figure out that better competition prepares you to be competitive against &#8220;select&#8221; competition, the kind you see beginning this weekend in the first round of the playoffs.\xC2\xA0 And it&#8217;s long been the contention within Covington, as well as outside, that to be better prepared you have to play better people on a consistent basis. \xC2\xA0 It&#8217;s\xC2\xA0 advantage enjoyed for several years now by those members of the Midwest Athletic Conference, Versailles, St. John, Coldwater, Marion and St. Henry, who have won 21 state titles between them.\xC2\xA0 And while Covington has been competitive on some occasions against the likes of Marion and Lehman, they&#8217;ve never beaten a MAC team in the playoffs.</p>\n\
    <p>Likewise, Tipp will see a team this weekend (Turpin) whose 10-0 record came as a member of the East Cincinnati Conference, featuring past state champion Anderson High School, who won the Division II title in 2007.\xC2\xA0 And Tipp was more than competitive against that same Turpin team last year, losing in the first round to the Spartans, 24-21.</p>\n\
    <p>The problem therefore becomes, how do you improve the relative competition that would better prepare you for the playoffs when you&#8217;re a member of a weak, or weaker, football conference?</p>\n\
    <p>That issue has been written about here on Press Pros, ad nauseum, and in truth dismissed by administrators and athletic directors about the Cross County Conference as being more trouble to address than its worth.\xC2\xA0 Most take the attitude that they&#8217;re helpless to change because a migration of the better programs to a more competitive league affiliation would leave the weaker schools with a myriad of other scheduling and affiliation issues.</p>\n\
    <p>But in fact\xC2\xA0better competition has irrefutably determined the\xC2\xA0history of area teams pertaining to their fortunes in the post-season.\xC2\xA0 Piqua and Trotwood, the only members of the Greater Western Ohio Conference to have won a state title in 2006 and &#8217;11, respectively, both honed for the challenge by playing the likes of the top Division I and II competition in the state.</p>\n\

    <p>Likewise, Versailles, Marion, St. Henry, Delphos, Minster\xC2\xA0and Coldwater, winners of all those titles, \xC2\xA0walk the gauntlet every week, playing each other with more than just league pride on the line.</p>\n\
    <p>&#8220;Surviving our league is generally tougher than most teams we see in the post-season,&#8221;\xC2\xA0 says Marion&#8217;s Tim Goodwin, who has six times advanced to the state\xC2\xA0championship game\xC2\xA0in his twelve seasons as head coach, winning five.\xC2\xA0 &#8220;At least until you get to the semi-final or final game.\xC2\xA0 By the time we get to the end of season we&#8217;re prepared to play anybody.&#8221;</p>\n\
    <p>8-2 this season, Marion is more than prepared as they face Bradford this weekend, the Railroaders making their first playoff appearance in 28 years.</p>\n\
    <p>For the record, Covington meets Dixie (7-3) on Saturday night, and history-wise the Buccs will have a decided advantage on the Greyhounds, a member of the Southwest Buckeye League who are making their first-ever playoff appearance.\xC2\xA0 The two teams have played five times previously, but not since 1963, and Covington has won the five previous meetings.</p>\n\
    <p>But in terms of their current competitive attributes, the Greyhounds own wins this year over past state champion Valley View, and a 28-27 win three weeks ago over Division IV Milton Union.</p>\n\
    <p>Yes, it&#8217;s playoff football, and if history tells us anything it&#8217;s simply this. \xC2\xA0 It certainly matters who you play when you get there.\xC2\xA0 But it&#8217;s usually<strong> who you&#8217;ve &#8220;played&#8221;</strong> to get there&#8230;that determines how far you go.</p>\n\
    <p>Over and over again!</p>\n\

    <p>Hurricane Sandy has washed out another day of school in Concord, and town officials will wait until morning to make a determination about whether to open town offices, officials said Monday night.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>After the powerful storm downed trees, closed roads and left much of the region without power for extended stretches on Monday, Oct. 29 -- the one year anniversary of last year's freak October snow storm -- a lost Monday will turn into a lost Tuesday for many.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>During the height of the storm, Concord fared better than most as far as power outages are concerned. However, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2farticles%2fconcord-s-hurricane-sandy-response-so-far\">emergency responders were busy clearing downed limbs and trees</a> on town roads and Route 2.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>After a day of wild weather Diana Rigby, the superintendent of schools, confirmed Monday night that school would be canceled again on Tuesday, Oct. 30.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>However, Town Manager Chris Whelan, said he plans to speak with Fire Chief Mark Cotreau and and CMLP Director Dave Wood at 6 a.m. Tuesday morning and will  decide then about opening Town offices.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"The primary problem now is power  outages and downed power lines raising safety concerns,\" Whelan said, adding a decision to close would be posted to the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcordma.gov\">town website</a>.</p>\n\

    <p>Since Hurricane Sandy's winds really started whipping wind 12 or 1 p.m., today, Oct. 29, Concord's emergency responders have been busy battling downed trees and wires.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CThe town\xE2\x80\x99s been out in just a constant effort to follow up on these wires and trees to keep the roads clear,\" Fire Chief Mark Cotreau said Monday afternoon.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The town's Department of Public Works has two loaders out that have been responding to push heavy trees out of the way so responders can maintain access along the town's roadways.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Meanwhile, Concord's Municipal Light Department has been dealing with power outages. A total of 600 customers lost power this morning, and that service restored, according to Cotreau, who said some minor outages may persist this afternoon and into the evening.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Since this morning, the Fire Department\xC2\xA0 has been on 14 calls for a variety of different reasons, Cotreau said, adding there have been no accidents, injuries or structures directly affected by falling trees or other storm damage.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>While the rains have been driving, the wind gusts have been equally, if not more powerful.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>After a day where thousands of New Englanders have lost power, roads and buildings have been flooded and winds-and-rain have lashed everyone, we're just on the verge of the worst of it.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Forecasters have been warning that Monday evening would be New England's moment of most severe intensity for Sandy. That prediction seems to be right on-target.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>\"Like a large nor'easter on steroids\"</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>According to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.accuweather.com%2f\">Accuweather</a> forecasters, Hurricane Sandy is poised for a New Jersey landfall any moment now.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Those same Accuweather forecasters are calling Sandy a \"Northeast catastrophe unfolding.\"\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Conditions will deteriorate through the day Monday with the worst of the storm spreading inland Monday night into Tuesday,\" says Accuweather.</p><p>That means the driving rain and whipping winds will be felt hundreds of miles inland, not just right on the coast.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>O, yes, and today's full moon will add to high-tide levels for coastal folks.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>While Accuweather is forecasting gusts up to 80 mph in the New Jersey area, the usually much calmer <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.weather.gov%2f\">weather.gov</a> is forecasting a slightly less blowy 60 mph for southern New England. But even it is saying damaging winds are expected in our area through Monday evening.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Some other forecasters are even a little more chill: <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2fnews%2fweather%2fweather_wisdom%2f2012%2f10%2fmain_part_of_storm_will_be_fel.html\">meterologist David Epstein on boston.com</a>\xC2\xA0says right now is the most intense; Sandy will lessen in intensity from here on our.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>So whether to choose to go with the more hyperbolic forecasts or the calmer ones, there is full agreement: Sandy is coming ashore in New Jersey now, and this evening will be New England's moments of greatest wind-and-rain intensity.</p>\n\

    <p>As <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpatchogue.patch.com%2farticles%2fpower-outages-piling-up-in-pat-med">power outages pile up</a>, some families may only have their cell phone available for accessing information. Should this happen, here are a number of phone settings to change in order to prolong your battery for as long as possible.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Turn Off Unnecessary Connections</strong></p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>For those with iPhones, Android or other smartphones, you can extend the battery by turning off WiFi, 4G and/or 3G connections if available, or even putting your phone into airplane mode and only taking it off when you want to use the phone. All of these connections use battery up whether using it or not.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Close All Background Applications</strong></p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Smartphones have apps, and sometimes they are running even when you do not want them to. If using an iPhone, double tap the home button to bring up a list of open applications at the bottom of your screen. Press and hold one of the icons, and then tap the red circle with the white horzontal line in it to deactivate each of them. If using an Android device, enter the device settings, and select "Manage Applications." There you can see which apps are running. Select the app you want to stop, and select the "Force Stop" option.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Lower Brightness Levels</strong></p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>In your phone's settings menu, reduce the brightness of the screen to the lowest acceptable level.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Keep Use To A Minimum</strong></p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>This may be a given, but other than necessary information try to keep phone use to a minimum. Especially for those with phones loaded with movies, music and other games. Try to stick to necessary calls, texts and checking news information like <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2farticles%2fhurricane-sandy-concord-info-center">on Patch</a>.</p><p>&#13;

    <p>HAMPTON, N.H. (AP) &mdash; A massive storm with winds topping 70 mph on Monday left more than 120,000 homes and businesses in the dark and swept away plans by the presidential campaigns to hold events in the state.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>A man was critically injured Monday evening in Windham by a falling tree as the state was being pounded by powerful gusts, said Katya Brennan, a spokeswoman for the state Emergency Operation Center. Windham police were unable to provide details.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The National Weather Service reported gusts of 60 mph in Portsmouth, 62 mph in Londonderry and 76 mph at the Isle of Shoals, just off the coast. Forecasters said rainfall could reach up to 4 inches.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Gov. John Lynch declared a state of emergency, urging motorists to stay off roads and sending nonessential state workers home at 3 p.m.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Water in the roadways, flying debris and downed power lines are all possible because of the severity of this storm, which is why we are urging people to stay off the roads unless absolutely necessary,&rsquo;&rsquo; Lynch said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Superstorm Sandy, no longer a hurricane, remained dangerous after slamming ashore in New Jersey and combining with two other weather systems.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Lynch encouraged people to stay away from the dangerous surf, but some were drawn to the ocean&rsquo;s fury. Dimitri Garbuzov was supposed to be working from home in Dover but was lured to Hampton Beach by the images he saw on a surf cam.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I just got into surfing recently, and I knew the waves were going to be impressive,&rsquo;&rsquo; the 30-year-old said. &lsquo;&lsquo;Plus, I've never seen what the ocean looks like in a storm.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Though the beach was closed, dozens of onlookers gathered on the sidewalks, some cheering as if they were on an amusement park ride each time a wave crashed over the seawall.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Goffstown&rsquo;s resident Elaine St. Pierre said she initially thought her husband was crazy to suggest driving to Hampton but called it &lsquo;&lsquo;a once-in-a-lifetime thing.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I'm glad we came, but I'll be glad to get home,&rsquo;&rsquo; St. Pierre, 69, said as she got sprayed by the water.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Some marshy areas and roads near the beach were flooded. In nearby Portsmouth, the library, City Hall and other buildings closed at 4 p.m. and Halloween trick-or-treating, originally planned for Tuesday, was postponed until Saturday. The ports of Portsmouth and Portland, Maine, took the unusual steps of closing to commercial traffic at 5 p.m., the Coast Guard said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Politicians surrendered to the storm. Democratic Vice President Joe Biden canceled a rally planned for Monday in Keene, and Republican Mitt Romney&rsquo;s wife, Ann Romney, called off her bus tour through the state. Both campaigns urged supporters to donate money, goods or supplies for the relief effort for Sandy victims.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Romney campaign volunteer Cheryl Poussard, of Hampstead, was looking forward to seeing Ann Romney. Instead, she stayed at the campaign&rsquo;s office in Derry and helped make phone calls.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Mitt Romney had planned to hold a rally in Milford on Tuesday night, but that also was canceled, as was first lady Michelle Obama&rsquo;s appearance at the University of New Hampshire.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In Concord, cooking supply shop owner Mike Beauregard said President Barack Obama&rsquo;s decision to cancel his campaign plans elsewhere Monday to focus on his official duties shouldn&rsquo;t be viewed as a political move.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;The last thing first responders need is for these folks to be running around,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Beauregard, an independent who leans Republican but declined to say for whom he&rsquo;s voting.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Numerous schools across the state were closed, and flights were canceled at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport. At least 13 shelters opened.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Earlier, Lynch put 100 New Hampshire Guard soldiers on active duty to conduct wellness checks, assist with debris removal and distribute food and water. Utilities secured crews from Canada and a number of states as they prepared for tree damage to equipment and prolonged power outages.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Public Service of New Hampshire, the largest utility in the state, requested an additional 550 line crews in addition to its own. Crews were arriving from Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. PSNH also staged 100 tree-trimming crews around the state and requested more.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Unitil Corp., which serves customers in the Seacoast area and around Concord, said it secured more than 250 crews from as far away as Michigan, Tennessee and Canada.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Unitil spokesman Alec O'Meara urged patience, saying some people will get their power restored only to lose it again.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a long time,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;&lsquo;before we see the other side of this storm.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

    <p>After a day where thousands of New Englanders have lost power, roads and buildings have been flooded and winds-and-rain have lashed everyone, we're just on the verge of the worst of it.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Forecasters have been warning that Monday evening would be New England's moment of most severe intensity for Sandy. That prediction seems to be right on-target.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>\"Like a large nor'easter on steroids\"</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>According to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.accuweather.com%2f\">Accuweather</a> forecasters, Hurricane Sandy is poised for a New Jersey landfall any moment now.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Those same Accuweather forecasters are calling Sandy a \"Northeast catastrophe unfolding.\"\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Conditions will deteriorate through the day Monday with the worst of the storm spreading inland Monday night into Tuesday,\" says Accuweather.</p><p>That means the driving rain and whipping winds will be felt hundreds of miles inland, not just right on the coast.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>O, yes, and today's full moon will add to high-tide levels for coastal folks.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>While Accuweather is forecasting gusts up to 80 mph in the New Jersey area, the usually much calmer <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.weather.gov%2f\">weather.gov</a> is forecasting a slightly less blowy 60 mph for southern New England. But even it is saying damaging winds are expected in our area through Monday evening.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Some other forecasters are even a little more chill: <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2fnews%2fweather%2fweather_wisdom%2f2012%2f10%2fmain_part_of_storm_will_be_fel.html\">meterologist David Epstein on boston.com</a>\xC2\xA0says right now is the most intense; Sandy will lessen in intensity from here on our.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>So whether to choose to go with the more hyperbolic forecasts or the calmer ones, there is full agreement: Sandy is coming ashore in New Jersey now, and this evening will be New England's moments of greatest wind-and-rain intensity.</p>\n\

    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; Across New Hampshire Wednesday shelters closed, schools reopened and utility crews continued to restore power to homes and businesses in the aftermath of Sandy.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>By 7:30 p.m., the number of homes and businesses without power was down to about 33,000 from a peak of 210,000. All customers are expected to have power back on by Friday.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The storm that started in earnest in the state on Monday didn&rsquo;t leave quietly, however. National Weather Service meteorologist Eric Sinsabaugh said a &lsquo;&lsquo;microburst&rsquo;&rsquo; of heavy rain and gusty wind hit Franklin just before 10 p.m. Tuesday, toppling large pines onto some cottages around Webster Lake. One unoccupied cottage was destroyed while others were damaged.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;We've had a lot worse,&rsquo;&rsquo; Franklin Fire Capt. Gary Hicks said, noting there were no reported injuries. &lsquo;&lsquo;But the people who suffered damage are not going to agree.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Sandy, which started as a hurricane before combining with two wintry weather systems to create a deadly superstorm, killed one New Hampshire resident, identified Wednesday as 42-year-old Eugene &lsquo;&lsquo;Rusty&rsquo;&rsquo; Brooks.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Brooks, a Woodstock construction company owner, had gone to check on a house foundation under construction in Lincoln. He was standing between a dirt cellar hole full of water and a pile of rocks that had been cleared during excavation when he was buried in a landslide of mud, water and rock.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;It was like standing on a dam that gave way,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Lincoln Police Chief Theodore Smith said. &lsquo;&lsquo;It basically was a really freak accident.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Smith, who had coffee with Brooks just before the accident, said many people in the area knew him and are devastated by his death.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>A Windham man was seriously injured when a tree fell on a car in which he was a passenger Monday afternoon. Three other people in the car were not hurt. William DeLuca III, 56, was taken to a Boston hospital and New Hampshire authorities did not know his condition.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>New Hampshire escaped the widespread destruction the storm brought to New York City and New Jersey. But Sandy meant that for the second year in a row, some communities postponed trick-or-treating. Last year, it was a surprise October snowstorm that put a damper on Halloween plans.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Cheryl Hass of Londonderry says her daughters &mdash; ages 8 and 10 &mdash; went from being thrilled Tuesday that trick-or-treating would still be on for Halloween night to being disappointed it&rsquo;s now postponed until Sunday.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Once you explain why they understand, but they&rsquo;re still disappointed,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;&lsquo;If people don&rsquo;t have power, it would be weird to trick-or-treat if you think about it.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>During the storm Monday, according to the National Weather Service, Goshen had the highest recorded winds of any community at 70 mph, though winds at the summit of Mount Washington were twice that. Randolph had the most rain, just over 6 inches.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="">
    <p>President Barack Obama on Tuesday granted Gov. John Lynch&rsquo;s request to issue an emergency disaster declaration for all 10 counties. That makes federal aid available to communities affected by the storm.<img alt="end of story marker" border="0" height="8" width="6" src="http://www.boston.com/r/SysConfig/WebPortal/Boston/Framework/images/site_graphics/dingbat_story_end_icon.gif" class="storyend"></p>

It traces how America&#8217;s move to independence was reported at the time in American and English newspapers. Every section shows some actual eighteenth-century news reports alongside a historian&#8217;s analysis of the event. </p><p>I wrote two sections. The first is on the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fPowder%2520Alarm">&#8220;Powder Alarm&#8221;</a> of September 1774, which signaled the <i>de facto</i> end of royal rule in most of New England; that doesn&#8217;t get a lot of space in most histories of the war because, well, nobody died. But it was a big deal for newspapers. Whig <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fprinters">printers</a> presented the notes of the mass gathering on <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fCambridge">Cambridge</a> common as if it were a formal meeting, and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fWilliam%2520Brattle">William Brattle</a> published a public letter trying to deny what he&#8217;d been caught saying in private&#8212;not that it did him any good.</p><p>My second essay is on the Battle of <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fLexington">Lexington</a> and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fConcord">Concord</a> eight months later. For that I took the approach of tracing how news of the event spread, starting with the first oral reports of <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fBritish%2520soldiers">British army officers</a> riding out of Boston. As with any fight, it took a while for the authorities and the press to sort out rumors, false claims, and facts. Newspapers in both America and Britain show how the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fMassachusetts%2520Provincial%2520Congress">Massachusetts Provincial Congress</a> did a much better job than Gen. <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fThomas%2520Gage">Thomas Gage</a> in spreading its version of events.

The list of contributors contains a lot of friends: Ray Raphael, Don Hagist, Ben Carp, Bob Allison, Will Tatum, Ben Irvin, Tom Fleming, as well as authors I know only through their books. At $39.99, it&#8217;s a coffee-table book with serious substance. </p><p><i>Reporting the Revolutionary War</i> has its own <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fbeforehistory.com%2f">website</a>, with content samples, contributor bios, videos, lesson plans, and more, plus a <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ffacebook.com%2freporting.revolution">Facebook page</a>.

    <li><strong>Clear out nearby storm drains: </strong>We could get more than two inches of rain from the storm, which could cause flooding problems. Clear away any leaves that may be blocking stormdrains near your house.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>Check your sump pump: </strong>For homes with basement sump pumps, you should check to make sure they are working properly.</li>&#13;\n\

    <p>There are a lot of things I do for exercise: bike, power walk, lift weights, even, occasionally, run, but only when forced to by my daughter. However, I\xE2\x80\x99ve never been able to convince myself to add swimming into my regimen. I think a big part of it is the cold \xE2\x80\x93 that water better be pretty darn warm for me to be willing to get into it. Plus there\xE2\x80\x99s the whole hair thing: It gets wet, and you have to dry it and style it and fuss with it. Yes, I have many excuses for staying out of the pool.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Not so for many others, as a day at <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.concordnet.org%2fpages%2fconcordma_recreation%2fbsfc\">Beede Center</a> will attest. The center's pools are full of lap swimmers and water aerobics doers and toddlers with parents in tow. And, as I recently learned, a girl training for the Olympics.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Yep. Right here in our local pool. Pretty cool, eh??</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>That girl is Gracia Leydon-Mahoney of Newton, and she trains here in Concord because this is where her coach, Tracey Bird, is. Tracey is an impressive swimmer in her own right: She was a champion diver for Stanford University when she was in college, and coached there for several years after. She moved to Concord in 1996 with her husband and two sons, has dabbled at Heritage and coached at <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2flistings%2fconcord-carlisle-regional-high-school\">CCHS</a> in the past.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Gracia\xE2\x80\x99s mom found Bird through a mutual friend; she had heard about her diving and coaching experience, knocked on her door, and asked her to take on Gracia. She did, and in just five years has coached Gracia into a diver on track to be an Olympian.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Last June, Gracia dove in the Olympic trials, where she placed seventh on the three-meter springboard and 10th on the platform dive. Then, just a few weeks ago, she was in Adelaide, Australia, where she won the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.fina.org%2fH2O%2findex.php%3foption%3dcom_content%26amp%3bview%3dcategory%26amp%3blayout%3dblog%26amp%3bid%3d116%26amp%3bItemid%3d747\">Junior World Championships</a>. Bird told me that this event is like the Olympics in the sense that all the top divers are there. Gracia beat the Chinese diver who was ahead of her by 20 points, and the third place diver was a woman from Great Britain who went to the Olympics.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Since Gracia is just 16-years-old. It would seem she\xE2\x80\x99s on the fast track to more championship diving; she\xE2\x80\x99s now moved to Durham, North Carolina, where there is a 10-meter board for her to train on for the Olympic trials. Even so, Bird is staying in touch with her training by communicating with the coach there.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>But Bird is keeping her toe in the pool, so to speak, heading to Stanford to help coach the college team there, just for the season. Then she\xE2\x80\x99ll be back swimming at the Beede, keeping an eye out, no doubt, for other Olympic hopefuls.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>&#13;\n\

    		<div class="firstGraph"><p>Sandy got a bit stronger overnight and winds are now over 85 miles per hour.  The storm looks to have just made the turn towards the west and should hit the coast early Tuesday.<br>
    <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2fnews%2fweather%2fweather_wisdom%2fsat_ir_ne_loop.gif%2520Monday.gif"><img alt="sat_ir_ne_loop.gif Monday.gif" src="http://www.boston.com/news/weather/weather_wisdom/assets_c/2012/10/sat_ir_ne_loop.gif Monday-thumb-600x480-86465.gif" width="600" height="480" class="mt-image-none"></a><br>
    The storm continues to be historic and once it makes land fall later today will transition from a pure tropical system to a non-tropical one.  That fact is simply semantics and for meteorologists to ponder as the effects will be the same. The big aspect to this storm for most people continues to be the wind.  Those people who live and have businesses on or very close to the water will have storm surge as well.  Winds will increase into early afternoon with the strongest gusts from about 2pm to 7pm. <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2fnews%2fweather%2fweather_wisdom%2fwinds%2520monday%2520am.gif"><img alt="winds monday am.gif" src="http://www.boston.com/news/weather/weather_wisdom/assets_c/2012/10/winds monday am-thumb-300x240-86467.gif" width="300" height="240" class="mt-image-left"></a>  It will still be very windy thereafter, but ever so slowly becoming less intense.  High tide is around noon and midnight and for those of you on the coast, the water may not retreat very much between tides today. <em>I am updating on this storm and of course future ones on Twitter at <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ftwitter.com%2fgrowingwisdom">@growingwisdom</a> please follow me there and ask any questions.</em>  This is becoming a nowcasting storm. Nowcasting is really looking at the information hour by hour and then making any changes to the forecast as needed. <br>
    </p></div>
    		<div class="articlePluckHidden"><p><strong>Today</strong><br>
    I think everyone has seen the projected track of the storm by now, but here it is again. From this point forward our weather deteriorates until about midnight tonight when things will ever so slowly begin the trend back from the intensity of the storm. <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2fnews%2fweather%2fweather_wisdom%2ftrack%2520monday%2520am.gif"><img alt="track monday am.gif" src="http://www.boston.com/news/weather/weather_wisdom/assets_c/2012/10/track monday am-thumb-300x240-86469.gif" width="300" height="240" class="mt-image-left"></a> The TV media will be in overdrive today and into tomorrow and I recommend  taking a break from the coverage from time to time.   News outlets are great for getting you information you need, but also they are a business and they want you to watch their coverage of the storm.  Those waves crashing over that seawall aren't going to go into most of our homes and the tree that falls on a house  will be the exception, not the rule.  Unfortunately there is going to be significant damage from Atlantic City through southern New England  to some infrastructure like boardwalks, subways and oceanfront homes, but most of you will just have to endure one, two or several days without power, a flooded basement or perhaps some damage to the yard.  I think it's important to keep in mind that of the 60 million people affected by the storm,  a relatively small number will have their lives impacted beyond a few days.  One caveat to that will be those commuters in New York.  If some of the subways flood, which is a possibility, that would end up creating a commuter's nightmare for quite a long time.  We won't know until late Monday if that is going to happen.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Wind</strong><br>
    <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2fnews%2fweather%2fweather_wisdom%2fwinds%2520predicted%2520Monday.png"><img alt="winds predicted Monday.png" src="http://www.boston.com/news/weather/weather_wisdom/assets_c/2012/10/winds predicted Monday-thumb-600x296-86455.png" width="600" height="296" class="mt-image-none"></a><br>
    The wind continues to be what I believe most of you will remember from this storm.  Often with storms the winds howls for a few hours and then it's done.  With this storm, the wind is going to be strong all day today.  I expect the winds to peak this afternoon and subside Tuesday.   The closer you are to the coast and the center of Sandy the earlier this afternoon the winds really begin to howl.  In the local Boston area by late morning we will start to see gusts over 50 miles per hour and power outages will begin becoming common. The long duration of the wind can cause trees to give, become uprooted and fall.  Some trees may also have cracks in them from past storms that have not healed.  This means the trees are weaker to start.   I have had two white pines come down over the past couple of years and barely miss the house.   That is one of my biggest concerns from this storm.   The further inland you are the less powerful the wind will be.  However, if you live on an exposed hill the winds can be gustier.  Those of you closest to the coast will have, on average, the highest winds.  Gusts of wind are going to be what takes down the power.  You will notice the wind range go from 20 miles per hour to as high as 50 miles per hour in just seconds.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Power loss</strong><br>
    If you don't lose power consider yourself fortunate.  I am planning on losing power and I made some food that we can eat when the power does go out.   Have your flashlight ready by the night stand and talk to the kids about what to do if they have to get up tonight without power.  Most of us still have power, but as the day goes on the number of outages will increase.  How long it takes to come back is anyone's guess, let's hope the power companies have a good plan for this, they certainly knew it was coming.</p><p><strong>Rainfall</strong><br>
    Rainfall doesn't look too bad for New England.  Those of you in the mid-Atlantic region will have much more rain and therefore flood issue.<a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2fnews%2fweather%2fweather_wisdom%2fRainfall%2520sunday%2520night.gif"><img alt="Rainfall sunday night.gif" src="http://www.boston.com/news/weather/weather_wisdom/assets_c/2012/10/Rainfall sunday night-thumb-300x239-86459.gif" width="300" height="239" class="mt-image-left"></a>  There is a flood watch up for parts of New England, but I am not overly concerned about flooding.   Check the basement from time to time just to be safe and be sure that drains near your house are not clogged.  </p>
    
    <p><strong>Storm surge</strong><br>
    The storm surge kills more people and does more damage than the wind.  From New Jersey to New York City all across Long Island and up the southern New England coastline the storm surge will cause damage.  The exact amount of damage is highly dependent on the particular spot along the coastline.   Little inlets where the water funnels can see much more damage than an open flat beach.  If the worst of the storm occurs at high tide that is much more damaging than at low tide. <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.boston.com%2fnews%2fweather%2fweather_wisdom%2fflooding%2520sunday%2520night.png"><img alt="flooding sunday night.png" src="http://www.boston.com/news/weather/weather_wisdom/assets_c/2012/10/flooding sunday night-thumb-300x180-86457.png" width="300" height="180" class="mt-image-left"></a> The reason is that at low tide, the surge has to get to the high tide point, then to flood levels.  If you start the surge at high tide, you have that much less room before things start flooding.   Monday and Tuesday are astronomically high tides as well.  This means that even without the storm, the tides on those days would be a bit higher than average.<br>
    <strong>Some tips</strong><br>
    Keep the fridge and freezer closed as much as possible if the power fails.  You can put things in a cooler you might need frequently like milk and juice.  They will keep for a while in the cooler.  If you have a grill, don't forget that once the winds calm down you can cook that way.  If you have power you can make a block of ice putting water in a freezer bag.  A solid block of ice keeps things cold for a long time.  That is why they use to call them "ice chests" after all.  Generators must be vented outside, you can kill you and your family in minutes running them inside.  Same tip goes for the car in the garage if you are charging your cell phone leave the door open while the car is running.   <br>
    <strong>After the storm</strong><br>
    When this is over there will be those who went to work, who had no damage and who didn't lose power.   For them, they might say "that wasn't so bad".  Others will have their lives turned upside down and still some may lose their lives.  The nature of these storms is that they don't hit all of us the same, but are all going to go through it.   I hope the blog has helped you prepare for the storm and will help you during it as well.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Tuesday-Friday</strong><br>
    Winds will subside on tomorrow and there will be a few leftover showers.  Since the storm will basically sit and spin itself to death over northern Maine I am not expecting rapid clearing.  We will see clouds and a few showers much of the week.  The sun will come out from time to time Thursday and Friday but we have to wait until the weekend for a truly sunny day.  Temperatures will be cool but not cold throughout the rest of the week.  A peak into next week shows that we may see a touch of mild weather.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Gardening this week</strong><br>
    There are many plants that bloom in the fall.  Toad lily, asters, mums, joe pye weed, roses and many others wait or continue blooming into late fall.  It's a good idea to have a garden with plants that bloom in all different season.  When I design my gardens I select plants that bloom from February to November here in the northeast.  Additionally, but adding some special evergreens, I can bring color to the garden all year long.<br>

    </p><p>The message is simple, and the habit can be lifesaving. Thirty-eight percent of fatal fire injuries occur in homes without working smoke alarms, while 24 percent occur in homes in which at least one smoke alarm is present but fails to operate, frequently due to dead or missing batteries.* For 25 years, the\xC2\xA0<i>Change Your Clock Change Your Battery</i><sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>program has been dedicated to helping share the life-saving reminder to change the batteries in your home\xE2\x80\x99s smoke and carbon monoxide detectors when you change your clocks for daylight savings.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>This year,\xC2\xA0<i>Energizer</i>\xC2\xA0and the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC) will mark the silver anniversary of one of the nation\xE2\x80\x99s top home fire safety programs by donating 250,000<i>Energizer<sub>\xC2\xAE</sub></i>\xC2\xA0MAX<sub>\xC2\xAE\xC2\xA0</sub>batteries to fire departments across the country to distribute to local families in their areas and adopting 25 fire departments in 25 cities across the nation, who, in addition to batteries, will be equipped with a variety<i>Energizer</i><sub>\xC2\xAE</sub>\xC2\xA0family safety products for their department and to share in their communities. Together, they will host Home Safety Days and neighborhood canvasses spanning throughout National Fire Prevention Month in October until the end of daylight saving time on Sunday, Nov. 4.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CIn the past 25 years, the number of home fire deaths has substantially decreased,\xE2\x80\x9D said Chief Hank Clemmensen, IAFC president and chairman of the board. \xE2\x80\x9CThat success is mostly thanks to the thousands of hours\xE2\x80\x94every year for 25 years\xE2\x80\x94that local fire departments have dedicated to improving the safety environment through technology, policy and, especially, public education efforts like the\xC2\xA0<i>Change Your Clock Change Your Battery<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>\xC2\xA0</i>program. But the world does not stand still, local fire department budgets are shrinking, many people still don\xE2\x80\x99t have a basic baseline of protection from smoke alarms, and we must keep pace with changes in technology and the built environment, It\xE2\x80\x99s still vital that homes be equipped with working smoke detectors in order to give families those critical extra seconds to escape.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>There are currently 23 million homes at risk of a fire because\xE2\x80\x94although they have smoke alarms\xE2\x80\x94the alarms are not functioning, mostly due to dead or missing batteries. Sharing the reminder to Change Your Clock Change Your Battery<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>\xC2\xA0is a simple way to help protect neighbors and loved ones. \xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CWe began the\xC2\xA0<i>Change Your Clock Change Your Battery</i><sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>program with the IAFC 25 years ago to do our part in helping to keep families safe, \xE2\x80\x9Csaid Michelle Atkinson, Vice President of Marketing for\xC2\xA0<i>Energizer</i>\xC2\xA0North America. \xE2\x80\x9CToday it\xE2\x80\x99s amazing to look back and see how the more than four million batteries donated through hundreds of neighborhood canvasses has translated to countless lives being saved. It\xE2\x80\x99s another example of our philosophy of\xC2\xA0<i>that\xE2\x80\x99s positivenergy</i><sub>\xE2\x84\xA2</sub>\xC2\xA0brought to life. We are grateful to the IAFC and local fire departments across the country for helping us share this message and make a positive impact.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The 25<sup>th</sup>\xC2\xA0anniversary of Change Your Clock Change Your Battery<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>\xC2\xA0kicked off Oct. 1 in Chicago, where the Chicago Fire Department was joined by MLB Hall of Famer and\xC2\xA0<i>that\xE2\x80\x99s positivenergy</i><sub>\xE2\x84\xA2</sub>\xC2\xA0Ambassador Cal Ripken, Jr. to honor the anniversary of the Great Chicago Fire. The Energizer Bunny<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>Brigade recreated the scene of the O\xE2\x80\x99Leary Barn, where by legend the fire started, and firefighters provided a fire safety demonstration for local students. Following, Ripken led the first of the neighborhood canvasses with fire officials in Southside Chicago who conducted fire safety inspections and surprised homeowners with Family Safety Kits, stocked with products designed to help keep homes safe including Kidde smoke detectors,\xC2\xA0<i>Energizer</i><sub>\xC2\xAE\xC2\xA0</sub>MAX<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>\xC2\xA0batteries and\xC2\xA0<i>Energizer</i><sub>\xC2\xAE</sub>Weatheready<sup>\xC2\xAE</sup>\xC2\xA0flashlights.</p><p>&#13;\n\

  title: Waltham officials evacuate 25 families from 1105 Lexington St.
  community_id: "30"

  content: "<div><div><p class=\"byline\">By Jaclyn Reiss and Evan Allen, Town Correspondents</p>\n\n\
    <p>Approximately 25 families are being evacuated from condominiums in Waltham after part of the roof blew off two buildings, according to Waltham police. </p>\n\n\
    <p>Waltham Mayor Jeannette McCarthy said that the evacuations were taking place at 1105 Lexington St. after a building inspector declared it unsafe at 6:05 p.m. No one was injured, fire department officials said. </p>\n\n\
    <p>The Waltham Fire Department was called out to the condo complex first around 5 p.m., but cleared the scene. They were then called back out at about 6 p.m., McCarthy said. </p>\n\n\
    <p>At the complex on Monday night, two three-story buildings - labeled numbers eight and 11 - had visibly damaged roofs that looked as if they had been peeled back. One of the roofs extended about 10 feet over the edge of the building, and could be seen waving in the wind. Scraps of metal and wood littered the ground near the buildings, and caution tape marked off the buildings.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Tim McMahon, 32, who lives in between the two damaged buildings, said he remembers that the roofs had been replaced a couple of years ago.</p>\n\n\
    <p>McMahon said that at about 2:30 p.m., he heard a noise that sounded like thunder and then the fire alarm in one of the buildings next to him, but could not tell what was wrong until fire department officials showed up to evacuate the buildings.</p>\n\n\
    <p>\"[The roof] was blatantly peeled back,\xC2\x94 McMahon said. \xC2\x93It doesn\xC2\x92t look good. It doesn\xC2\x92t look sturdy.\xC2\x94</p>\n\n\
    <p>McMahon said that the roof also made a distinct creaking noise as it blew in the wind.</p>\n\n\
    <p>\"Every little noise makes you want to take a step back,\" he said.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Fire officials said they could not answer if the roof's condition is deemed secure as Hurricane Sandy's wind continues to blow it back and forth tonight. </p>\n\n\
    <p>\"Everybody is cleared there, and it has been turned over to the building's owners,\" said Waltham Fire Deputy Chief Andrew Mullin. </p>\n\n\
    <p>McCarthy said that officials directed the evacuees to the city's emergency shelter at Jonathan Bright Elementary School at 260 Grove St. However, most families have made arrangements to stay with friends and family, McCarthy said. </p>\n\n\
    <p>She said that the city has 150 cots and blankets for evacuees, which would have been enough to accommodate all 25 families if needed. </p>\n\n\
    <p>McCarthy said other than one other person using the emergency shelter, this is the only larger-scale evacuation in the city that officials are aware of. </p>\n\n\

    <p>As <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpatchogue.patch.com%2farticles%2fpower-outages-piling-up-in-pat-med">power outages pile up</a>, some families may only have their cell phone available for accessing information. Should this happen, here are a number of phone settings to change in order to prolong your battery for as long as possible.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Turn Off Unnecessary Connections</strong></p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>For those with iPhones, Android or other smartphones, you can extend the battery by turning off WiFi, 4G and/or 3G connections if available, or even putting your phone into airplane mode and only taking it off when you want to use the phone. All of these connections use battery up whether using it or not.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Close All Background Applications</strong></p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>Smartphones have apps, and sometimes they are running even when you do not want them to. If using an iPhone, double tap the home button to bring up a list of open applications at the bottom of your screen. Press and hold one of the icons, and then tap the red circle with the white horzontal line in it to deactivate each of them. If using an Android device, enter the device settings, and select "Manage Applications." There you can see which apps are running. Select the app you want to stop, and select the "Force Stop" option.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Lower Brightness Levels</strong></p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>In your phone's settings menu, reduce the brightness of the screen to the lowest acceptable level.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><strong>Keep Use To A Minimum</strong></p><p>&#13;
    </p><p>This may be a given, but other than necessary information try to keep phone use to a minimum. Especially for those with phones loaded with movies, music and other games. Try to stick to necessary calls, texts and checking news information like <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpatchogue.patch.com%2ftopics%2fhurricane-sandy-long-island">on Patch</a>.</p><p>&#13;
    </p><p><em>Stay safe, and Patch will continue to update with storm information.</em></p>

    <p>They don't scare easy.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>For the past 10 years, the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.halloweeninlexington.com%2f\">Lexington Retailers Association has hosted a \"Halloween Trick or Treat\" with local businesss</a> around town.This year's is scheduled for 2 to 5 p.m. on Halloween, this Wedesday, Oct. 31. And, according to Jerry Michelson of the LRA, Hurricane Sandy hasn't changed those plans.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Last year's freak Octoboer snowstorm caused the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexington.patch.com%2farticles%2fretailers-association-trick-or-treat-postponed\">Trick or Treat to be postponed for a few days</a>, but Michelson said late last week that he's hopeful it won't happen again this year. The association, however, would push the event back a few days should town officials request they do so due to storm-related damage, as was the case last year, he said.</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>But, the refrigerator will only keep food safely cold for about four hours if unopened during a power outage, according to the USDA. A full freezer will hold the temperature for about 48 hours if full (24 hours of half full), the USDA says.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The USDA emphasizes \"never to taste food to determine its safety\" and says that you should \"evaluate each item separately.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Generally, if the temperature in the thermometer in the freezer reads 40 degrees Fahrenheit or below, the food is safe and can be refrozen, according to the USDA.

Whig <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fprinters">printers</a> presented the notes of the mass gathering on <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fCambridge">Cambridge</a> common as if it were a formal meeting, and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fWilliam%2520Brattle">William Brattle</a> published a public letter trying to deny what he&#8217;d been caught saying in private&#8212;not that it did him any good.</p><p>My second essay is on the Battle of <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fLexington">Lexington</a> and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fConcord">Concord</a> eight months later. For that I took the approach of tracing how news of the event spread, starting with the first oral reports of <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fBritish%2520soldiers">British army officers</a> riding out of Boston. As with any fight, it took a while for the authorities and the press to sort out rumors, false claims, and facts. Newspapers in both America and Britain show how the <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fMassachusetts%2520Provincial%2520Congress">Massachusetts Provincial Congress</a> did a much better job than Gen. <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fThomas%2520Gage">Thomas Gage</a> in spreading its version of events. And you can read the actual articles, reproduced in color on pages about 10x10 inches. </p><p><i>Reporting the Revolutionary War</i> extends from the Sugar and <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fStamp%2520Act">Stamp Acts</a> in the 1760s through <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fboston1775.blogspot.com%2fsearch%2flabel%2fGeorge%2520Washington">Washington</a>&#8217;s resignation as commander-in-chief in 1783. The list of contributors contains a lot of friends: Ray Raphael, Don Hagist, Ben Carp, Bob Allison, Will Tatum, Ben Irvin, Tom Fleming, as well as authors I know only through their books. At $39.99, it&#8217;s a coffee-table book with serious substance. </p><p><i>Reporting the Revolutionary War</i> has its own <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fbeforehistory.com%2f">website</a>, with content samples, contributor bios, videos, lesson plans, and more, plus a <a href="http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ffacebook.com%2freporting.revolution">Facebook page</a>.

    </p><ul><li><strong>Remove yard items: </strong>Take in Halloween decorations, political signs, tables and chairs, barrels, trash cans and anything else that can get swept up by the wind and become dangerous.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>Power up: </strong>Recharge everything, including laptops and cell phones.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>Have flashlights at the ready: </strong>Track down the flashlights throughout your home and make sure you have them in a place that you\xE2\x80\x99ll find if you lose power.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>Check your battery supply: </strong>Check to make sure you have enough flashlight batteries to get you through the storm and aftermath. Some officials have warned that we may see power outages that last for days in some areas.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>Clear out nearby storm drains: </strong>We could get more than two inches of rain from the storm, which could cause flooding problems. Clear away any leaves that may be blocking stormdrains near your house.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>Check your sump pump: </strong>For homes with basement sump pumps, you should check to make sure they are working properly.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>Follow Patch: </strong>Whether it\xE2\x80\x99s <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexington.patch.com%2fnewsletters\">our free morning newsletter</a>, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.facebook.com%2flexingtonpatch\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2ftwitter.com%2flexingtonpatch\">Twitter,</a> <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.patch.com%2fmobile\">downloading our app</a>\xC2\xA0or <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexington.patch.com\">returning to our homepage</a>, come back to Patch today and throughout the storm for the latest on information about the storm and how it's affecting Grafton.\xC2\xA0</li>&#13;\n\

  community_id: "31"

    <p>CLEVELAND, Ohio - The consensus is that the Ohio Bobcats will run the table in the 
    2012-2013 Mid-American Conference men&#8217;s basketball season. That hasn&#8217;t 
    been done since Kent State in 2008.</p><p>But with five starters back plus an experienced, albeit new coach in Jim
     Christian, the team that rose from third during the 2012 MAC regular 
    season to win the 2012 MAC Tournament is expected to continue its roll 
    this season. <br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;This is a very mature group with some high expectations,&#8221; Christian said.</p>
    <p>The only real challenge is expected to come from the Akron Zips, the defending MAC regular-season champs and a team the Bobcats narrowly topped in the MAC Tournament, 64-63. OU was awarded 141 tallies to 122 for the Zips. Kent State was picked third with 89.&nbsp;</p><p>OU&#8217;s 2012 roll extended to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament, landing coach John Groce a new gig at Illinois. Enter Christian, who had a five-year run as head coach at Kent State which included a pair of NCAA Tournament appearances (2005, 2008) plus the last MAC team (2008) to rank in the AP Top 25 during the regular season.</p><p>Several teams, including Western Michigan, Kent State, Northern Illinois and Central Michigan, are loaded with youth and inexperience, which is a cause of concern for WMU coach Steve Hawkins.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;I think you might see something you seldom see in this league, which is blowouts,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If (the youth) don&#8217;t get it, they&#8217;re not going to get beat, they&#8217;re going to get drilled.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>The favorites don&#8217;t have that concern. The Zips (22-12, 13-3 last season) return four of five starters from a team that split its two regular season games with OU last season before falling in the MAC Tournament. &nbsp;</p><p>In the MAC West, the Toledo Rockets (143) are favored over defending division champion Eastern Michigan (118). However, Toledo will not be eligible for the MAC Tournament or the postseason due to NCAA academic sanctions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mid-American Conference East Division projected order of finish</strong></p>

    <p>Ohio has already been affected by the <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2f2012%2f10%2f29%2fhurricane-sandy-eyes-dc-baltimore_n_2037749.html\">FrankenStorm, also known as Hurricane Sandy</a>, but our neighbors to the east are getting hit much worse.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>And if you're safe and sound at home, you may feel compelled to do something to help them. There are many ways to help, we're just featuring two options in this story: American Red Cross and Salvation Army.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><h2></h2><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>When the electricity goes out and people need shelter, it's usually the American Red Cross that sets up those shelters in schools, churches or community centers.\xC2\xA0They provide cots to sleep on, food and a safe place to rest.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Sunday, the Red Cross had already set up <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.redcross.org%2fnews%2fpress-release%2fThousands-Look-to-Red-Cross-For-Shelter-from-Sandy\">112 shelters in nine states</a>. That's just the beginning.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>But all that costs money and while the Red Cross was created by the U.S. government, it doesn't get money from the government. That's why they ask the public for help.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Want to help financially?</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>People can <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.redcross.org\">give online through the Red Cross website</a>\xC2\xA0or call 1-800-RED-CROSS or they can text the word REDCROSS to 90999 to make a $10 donation.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Want to volunteer?</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Give blood. The Red Cross provides about 40 percent of the nation's blood supply and the storm has forced many blood drive cancelations, they have reported on their website. Find your local donation place by <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.redcrossblood.org\">checking out the website</a> or call 1-800-RED-CROSS.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    &#13;\n\
    </p><h2></h2><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The Salvation Army doesn't just ring bells at Christmas time in the malls. They help people with that money they raise.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>And they're ready to help support emergency crews helping those affected by Hurricane Sandy with supplies that they can transport in their own disaster vehicles, Major David Dunham of the Summit County branch said in a prepared statement.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Want to help financially?\xC2\xA0</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>You can <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.salvationarmyusa.org\">give online</a> or by calling 1-800-SAL-ARMY(1-800-725-2769).\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>You can also text STORM to 80888 and it will automatically make a donation of $10 through your cell phone. Just respond 'yes' to confirm the donation.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>They aren't accepting clothing or furniture for those affected by the hurricane, but perhaps folks closer to home could use that stuff, so consider donating it to the Salvation Army store.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Want to volunteer?\xC2\xA0</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.disaster.salvationarmyusa.org\">Register online</a> but note you have to undergo disaster training first; not everybody who volunteers will be called to help.\xC2\xA0</p>\n\

  content: "<div><div><p>By Helen Mastro</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>School mornings are stressful enough as it is: getting the kids ready for school, making sure homework is packed, and catching the bus can feel like an entire day of its own. But before sending them off to school, you should consider what you packed for their lunch, and more importantly, how you packed it.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>While children may want to tote their sandwiches in their favorite cartoon-themed lunch box, many lunch boxes are not the safest way to carry food. Perishable items like mayonnaise, milk, leftover meats or cold cuts may not stay sufficiently cold to prevent bacterial growth on the food. Harmful bacteria multiply between 40 and 140 degrees, and might subject your children to food-borne illness.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>According to USDA food safety guidelines, insulated bags or boxes plus an ice pack are best for keeping foods cold.\xC2\xA0 As many come in cartoon and themed designs, your children can still bring their favorite lunch bag to school with an ice pack in it, which keeps food at safe temperatures. Older children who have outgrown sporting a lunchbox should use an insulated tote over a brown bag. Unlike a brown bag, the totes have an insulated lining that accompanies a freezer pack to help keep food cold.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>In addition to ensuring your children\xE2\x80\x99s food is kept at a safe temperature, you should also carefully consider what to pack in their lunch box. For starters, pack some protein. Food packed with protein tends to keep people fuller longer. A turkey sandwich on whole-wheat bread or baked chicken breasts (and remember: leftovers should be prepared safely and chilled well!) are good choices.\xC2\xA0 Raw vegetables, fruit, yogurt, and trail mix or granola bars also are wise choices since they are packed with nutrition. Make sure snacks are low in fat and sugar (less than 2 grams of fat, less than 10 grams of sugar). When it comes to beverages, skip the juice box and give your children water or a milk box.\xC2\xA0 As an added bonus, you can put these drinks in the freezer overnight. The drink can serve as extra insulation to keep the lunchbox cold.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Before your children dig into their healthy lunch, have them wash their hands first. Soap and water does the job fine, but if not available, pack an antibacterial wipe or a small bottle of hand sanitizer (depending on child\xE2\x80\x99s age) in their backpack which they can use to clean their hands and their area of the lunch table before unpacking their food. You should also clean their lunchbox occasionally to reduce the spread of germs. A disinfecting spray or washing it in the sink with warm, soapy water will do the trick.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>By using these tips, you can help ensure that your children have a great and healthy day at school!</p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) &mdash; A construction worker checking a job site in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy was swept to his death by a landslide Tuesday in Lincoln as utility crews elsewhere worked to restore power to hundreds of thousands of customers across the state.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>After peaking at about 210,000, the number of outages had dropped to about 128,000 by Tuesday afternoon, and officials said all should be resolved by Saturday. Most outages appeared to be caused by downed lines, not topped poles that take longer to fix, said Public Utilities Commission Chairwoman Amy Ignatius.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In Lincoln, Police Chief Theodore Smith said police were notified just before 8:30 a.m. about the fatal accident involving a construction crew checking on a home foundation they had been building. The victim&rsquo;s identity wasn&rsquo;t released.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;The embankment gave way and turned into a landslide of mud, rock and all the water that was in the hole,&rsquo;&rsquo; Smith said. &lsquo;&lsquo;It washed him down the equivalent of a 2-3 story incline.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Other members of the construction crew pulled the man out of the debris and started CPR, but he was declared dead in the ambulance on the way to the hospital, Smith said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The National Weather Service recorded gusts Monday evening of 60 mph in Portsmouth, 62 mph in Londonderry and 76 mph at the Isle of Shoals, 6 miles off the coast. Forecasters said rainfall could reach 4 inches. Mount Washington recorded a peak wind gust of 140 mph.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In Windham, a powerful gust caused a tree to fall on a vehicle Monday evening, leaving a man critically injured. Windham police were unable to provide details.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>It was the fourth worst storm in terms of power outages in state history, affecting about 30 percent of customers receiving electricity in the state. The worst was in December 2008 when an ice storm knocked out electricity to 422,000 homes and businesses, Ignatius said. A wind storm in February 2010 affected 360,000 customers and last October&rsquo;s snowstorm cut power to 315,000.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In Durham, downed trees left residents along a stretch of Durham Point Road stranded Tuesday, though one resident said she and her neighbors were taking it in stride. Katie Delahaye Paine, who runs a public relations firm from her Durham home and an office in Berlin, said was relieved to find out that her 94-year-old cousin who lives down the road was at a rehab center and not at home and that other neighbors also had checked on him.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s very sort of classic New Hampshire &mdash; people sitting there saying, &lsquo;If I could just get a bulldozer onto that tree, I could get it out of the way,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;&lsquo;Great neighborhood spirit.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The road also was humming with the noise of power generators, she said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Five years ago, you'd go for a run or walk the morning after a storm and it would be deadly quiet. Now, there&rsquo;s a generator at every single house,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Paine, who fired hers up to power her refrigerator, coffee pot and computer.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>In Manchester, Nancy Crowley&rsquo;s power went out around 9 p.m. Monday. The only surprise was that it stayed on as long as it did.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;We've been very consistently hit every time, so I was expecting it much earlier,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Crowley, 43, who bought a generator after last October&rsquo;s snowstorm left her family in the dark for nine days. &lsquo;&lsquo;I was a little deflated when the power went out.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Gov. John Lynch said Sandy did not cause the extensive and damaging flooding of past storms, but comparisons don&rsquo;t matter much to those people who are without electricity.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s still pretty significant to them,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>President Barack Obama on Tuesday granted Lynch&rsquo;s request to issue an emergency disaster declaration for all 10 counties.  It will make federal assistance available for impacted communities. State officials urged local government officials to keep records of any spending to aid in getting reimbursed.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Five shelters opened Monday, but Health and Human Services Commissioner Nick Toumpas said only 57 people went to the shelters and of those, only 43 spent the night in them.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The storm swept away plans by the presidential campaigns to hold events in New Hampshire, but campaigning for state offices resumed Tuesday. And former President Bill Clinton was expected to return to campaign this week for President Obama.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Ignatius said polling places should be open with power and telephone lines on Election Day.</p>
    </div>
                <div class="">
    <p>At the Children&rsquo;s Museum of New Hampshire, the phone started ringing early Tuesday morning as parents looked for alternatives to spending the day at home with their children and no power. There was a line waiting at the door when the museum opened at 10 a.m., said marketing director Heidi Duncanson.

    <p>Halloween is fun and trick or treating for free candy, as any child will tell you, is just plain awesome. However, there are risks and we must do what we can to make the holiday as safe as possible for the little ghouls and ghosts roaming the neighborhoods.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Here are some safety tips from security consultant and <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexington.patch.com%2fblog_posts%2fhalloween-safety-tips-e84c115e\">Patch blogger David Cullen</a>.\xC2\xA0 Check them out and go over the trick-or-treating safety  tips with any child heading <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fpatch.com%2fA-zc1k\">out in search of candy tomorrow</a>\xC2\xA0on Halloween. It will only take a  few minutes and could make a big difference.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>FOR TRICK-OR-TREATERS:</strong></p><p>1. Carry a flashlight and walk, don't run. </p><p>2. Stay on sidewalks; obey traffic signals. </p><p>3. Stay in familiar neighborhoods. </p><p>4. Don't cut across yards or driveways. </p><p>5. Wear a watch you can read in the dark. </p><p>6. Make sure costumes don't drag on the ground. </p><p>7. Shoes should fit (even if they don't go with your costume). </p><p>8. Avoid wearing masks while walking from house to house. </p><p>9. Carry only flexible knives, swords or other props. </p><p>10. (lf no sidewalk) walk on left side of the road facing traffic. </p><p>11. Wear clothing with reflective markings/tape. </p><p>12. Approach only houses that are lit. </p><p>13. Stay away from and don't pet animals you don't know.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>FOR PARENTS:</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>1. Make sure your child eats dinner before setting out. </p><p>2. Children should carry quarters so they can call home or consider the pluses/minuses of a cell phone. </p><p>3. Ideally, an adult should accompany young children of any age. </p><p>4. If your children go on their own, be sure they wear a watch, preferably one that can be read in the dark. </p><p>5. lf you buy a costume, look for one made of flame- retardant material. </p><p>6. Older children should know where to reach you and when they need to be home. </p><p>7. You should know where they're going. </p><p>8. Although tampering is rare, tell children to bring candy home to be inspected before consuming anything. </p><p>9. Look at the wrapping carefully and toss out anything that looks suspect.</p><p><strong>FOR HOMEOWNERS </strong></p><p>1. Make sure your yard is clear of such things as ladders, hoses, dog leashes, flower pots, etc. that can trip young ones. </p><p>2. Pets get frightened on Halloween. Put them someplace to protect them from cars or inadvertently biting a trick-or-treater.</p><p>3.  Battery powered jack o'lantern candles are preferable to a real flame.  If you do use candles, place the pumpkin well away from were  trick-or-treaters will be walking or standing. Make sure paper or cloth  yard decorations won't be blown into a flaming candle. </p><p>4.  Healthy food alternatives for trick-or-treaters include pre-packaged  low-fat crackers with cheese or peanut butter filling, single-serve  boxes of cereal, packaged fruit rolls, mini boxes of raisins and  single-serve packets of low-fat popcorn that can be microwaved later.  Non-food treats: plastic rings, pencils, stickers, erasers, coins, etc. </p><p><strong>BEFORE TRICK OR TREATING: </strong></p><p>1.  Plan costumes that are bright and reflective. Make sure that shoes fit I  well and that costumes are short enough to prevent tripping,  entanglement or contact with flame. </p><p>2. Consider adding reflective tape or striping to costumes and trick-or-treat bags for greater visibility. </p><p>3.  Secure emergency identification (name, address, phone number)  discreetly within Halloween attire or on a bracelet. Not on the outside  of clothing where anyone can see it. </p><p>4. Because a mask can limit  or block eyesight, consider non-toxic and hypoallergenic makeup or a  decorative hat as a safe alternative. </p><p>5. When shopping for costumes, wigs and accessories purchase only those with a label indicating they are flame resistant. </p><p>6.  Think twice before using simulated knives, guns or swords. If such  props must be used, be certain they do not appear authentic and are soft  and flexible to prevent injury. </p><p>7. Obtain flashlights with fresh batteries for all children and their escorts. </p><p>8. Plan ahead to use only battery powered lanterns or chemical\xC2\xA0light sticks\xC2\xA0in place of candles in decorations and costumes. </p><p>9. This is also a great time to buy fresh batteries for your smoke alarms.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Now that you's safe, have fun and take pictures! </strong></p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>More than 2,000 Lexington residents remain without power as crews continue to respond to trees toppled by Monday\xC2\x92s hurricane, but officials are hopeful trick-or-treating won't be canceled.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Town Manager Carl Valente said there are nine locations spread out around the town where major trees are down and tangled up in utility wires.</p><p>But overall, Valente said Lexington faired well in the storm.</p>\n\n\
    <p>\xC2\x93It\xC2\x92s not that bad for us,\xC2\x94 he said. \xC2\x93Most of the town is in good shape.\xC2\x94</p>\n\n\
    <p>Valente said no injuries or major structural damage was reported from the storm.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Town officials will be meeting later this afternoon to discuss whether schools will reopen Wednesday, and to discuss whether or not Halloween activities should be curtailed.</p>\n\n\

    <p>Trick-or-treaters may have a few remaining fallen branches to contend with Wednesday, but Valente said Tuesday morning that he\xC2\x92s assuming Halloween will still be on tomorrow night. </p>\n\n\
    <p>\xC2\x93We think we\xC2\x92ll be ok with some common sense on behalf of parents,\xC2\x94 Valente said.</p></div>\n\n\

    </p><ul><li>As of 11:15 a.m. NSTAR reports 2,415 customers (18%) without power.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Six streets are blocked by fallen trees and power lines to traffic with detours in place at the following locations: Mass Ave at Audubon, Lowell Street at 508 (near East Street); Grant Street at Sherman; Grove Street at Tidd Circle; Charles Street at Camden Street; and Shade Street.\xC2\xA0</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Police and Fire Departments have added additional staff and crews to handle extra emergency incidents over the last 24-hours.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>The Town is utilizing private tree companies to supplement on-duty public works staff with removal of downed trees and cleanup.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Tree crews are working with NSTAR who de-energize power temporally allowing tree crews to remove downed trees. This may cause additional brief power outages during the day.\xC2\xA0</li>&#13;\n\
    </ul><p>The public is urged to stay away from any downed wires and assume they are electrically charged. Sidewalks and some streets still have significant tree debris allowing for limited safe passage. Use caution and common sense when traveling these sidewalks and roadways. Tree debris from resident\xE2\x80\x99s property can be transported to the Compost Facility on Hartwell Avenue, which is opened today. Trash pick-up is delayed one-day all week.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>Tasting notes (wines that received at least one vote are accompanied by a note) are from sommeliers Brahm Callahan, Jason Kilgore, Kate Moore, and Globe wine writer Ellen Bhang. The shop name with each wine is the retailer who nominated it. Most of the bottles have good distribution in our area. Check with your local wine shop, and if they don&rsquo;t have the wine you are looking for, they can probably get it for you. Wines for this year&rsquo;s tasting were purchased at Berman&rsquo;s Wine and Spirits, Lexington (781-862-0515), D&amp;L Liquors, Waltham (781-894-1907), Henry&rsquo;s Wine Cellar, North Beverly (978-524-0300), Medfield Wine Shoppe, Medfield (508-359-4097), and Sudbury Wine &amp; Spirits, Sudbury (978-443-1300). </p>

    <p>Data from the study at 25 U.S. sites will be used to support a pre-market application for EndoBarrier, a thin, flexible, tube-shaped liner that forms a physical barrier between food and a portion of the wall of the intestine.</p>
    <p>The company said that in 12 clinical studies conducted globally and one in the U.S., involving more than 500 patients, EndoBarrier has been shown to achieve rapid reductions in blood sugar levels, improvement of cardiovascular risk factors including blood pressure, cholesterol and triglycerides, and weight loss of about 20 percent in 12 months.</p>
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>EndoBarrier is currently commercially available in select countries in Europe, including Germany, Austria, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, as well as Australia and Chile.</p>

    <p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>When we moved into our new home a year ago I was thrilled, great town, great schools, great next door neighbors. Life was good. I did however begin to miss living in a traditional neighborhood. We live on a bust street and while I do like the constant hustle and bustle of that, I worried we wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t get to know our extended neighbors. I chalked it up to one of the few things I would have to give up living in our new house, could be worse.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xC2\xA0Life was moving along fairly well and we had a great relationship with our next door neighbors from day one. Soon, new neighbors moved in behind us and we started enjoying playing with their son, sharing a glass of wine and just hanging out. Soon I was introduced to another family on the other side of our block. A play date came next and then the idea of a block party. I thought at least there would be four families to anchor my attempt to create a neighborhood. I joined forces with my next door neighbor, made flyers and reached out to several other families on our block and down our street. The RSVP\xE2\x80\x99s came rolling in and I started getting very excited.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>As if it was all meant to be the pending hurricane held off, the skies were clear and the air warm. The kids helped with set up carefully placing their outdoor toys around the yard for their new friends to enjoy. \xC2\xA0Leaves were raked, the lawn was cut and we even managed to get the driveway safety net up for rolling balls or runaway toddlers. I used the sidewalk chalk to write a message of welcome to our new friends and my son offered up his birthday balloons for the party. Neighbors showed up with fun side dishes, kids came with bikes and scooters. The young and the not so young played, ate good food and got to know one another. I shook a lot of hands, asked for reminders of names several times and pointed out my house to my new friends feeling all the while very satisfied with my efforts to create a neighborhood on my busy street.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The day turned to night, the younger kids went home for bed and an outdoor fire kept the older kids and adults happy for hours. I learned that my son has two neighborhood kids that would be attending Kindergarten with him next year, that my daughter is great at making a little ones feel comfortable with the big kids and that my neighbor who recently lost her husband is doing OK and still has her great sense of humor.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>When midnight rolled around (yes, midnight) and the last log fizzled out we packed it up and called it a day/night. And as the last guest waved goodbye and I repeated their names as not to forget I thought about the next block party with what would then be old friends and maybe even some new. I always thought the sign of a successful party was thinking about the next with eager anticipation. I can\xE2\x80\x99t wait to throw our next block party! \xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0</p>\n\

Price, who is black, even volunteered for the campaign.</p>
    <p>Price became disillusioned when the president abandoned his push for a public insurance option in his health care bill and extended the George W. Bush-era tax cuts.</p>
    <p>When President Obama embraced same-sex marriage in May, "that was the last straw for me," said Price, 52, an ordained minister who owns a Cincinnati business and technology consulting firm. He decided to boycott the Nov. 6 election.</p>
    <p>But watching the vice presidential candidates discuss abortion in their debate, Price had a change of heart. "We've had 54 million babies murdered in this country," said Price, referring to the number of legal abortions since the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. "The Lord spoke to me in a very clear way."</p>                                                <div class="medcity-paid-inline">

    <p>This year, he will vote for Republican Mitt Romney.</p>
    <p>The idea that black voters will desert Obama in meaningful numbers is unthinkable to most political observers. But in Ohio, whose voters will probably determine who lives in the White House for the next four years, a question flickers like a tiny flame of hope for some Republicans: Could a small number of black voters, sufficiently angry or disappointed with the president, be persuaded to vote against him? If so, could that make a difference in the outcome?</p>
    <p>"Put it this way," said Leonard Hubert, 59, a black lifelong Republican from Granville, near Cincinnati, and a member of the Ohio Civil Rights Commission. "They are less enthused and energized about Obama. Some are going to vote for Romney and some are going to not vote at all."</p>
    <p>Just about everyone who follows politics in Ohio thinks there will be a drop in African-American support for Obama, who earned 96 percent of the black vote here in 2008. The question is, how much?</p>
    <p>"I think it would be in the narrowest sense a victory for the Romney campaign if he could hold President Obama's take of the African-American vote in Ohio to 90 percent," said former Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell, who is African-American. That could mean tens of thousands of votes, a sliver of the total, but potentially crucial in a tight contest.</p>
    <p>Still, many black conservatives said they were frustrated at what they thought was a missed opportunity. While the Democratic Party takes the black vote for granted, they say, the Republican Party assumes it is unobtainable.</p>
    <p>"The marriage issue, the life issue, the fact that black unemployment is still double, even in Ohio," Blackwell said. "There's a collection of issues that have fed discontent and provides an opportunity for swinging 6 percent."</p>
    <p>It's clear that things are different from four years ago.</p>
    <p>On Wednesday night, the Cleveland gospel radio station Praise 1300 hosted a lively debate among black callers. One man compared Obama's embrace of same-sex marriage to the "coming of Sodom and Gomorrah," but said he planned to vote for him anyway.</p>
    <p>A woman who said she was a graduate of Howard University said, "I don't see anything the president has done for me personally. It just sickens me to think everybody wants to vote for him. I am for Mitt Romney. I am for biblical principles."</p>
    <p>Republicans often point out that in 2004, President George W. Bush received a surprisingly high 18 percent of the black vote in Ohio, but, as Blackwell noted, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage on the state ballot that year helped drive turnout.</p>
    <p>Voters face no such proposal this year, but some conservatives are hoping to arouse some of the same anti-gay-marriage sentiments.</p>
    <p>One obstacle they face: After the president spoke in support of gay marriage, the NAACP endorsed the position as well. Black support for same-sex marriage went up almost instantly across the country, including from some unexpected quarters.</p>
    <p>"When rappers start coming out in favor of gay rights," said Eric McDaniel, a University of Texas government professor who studies race, religion and politics, "you know something has changed."</p>
    <p>McDaniel challenged the assumption that African-Americans would defect from Obama in any meaningful way over gay marriage or any other social issue.</p>
    <p>"These issues don't mobilize African-Americans," he said. "They might be opposed to gay marriage, but it's not something they are going to march over. ... At the end of the day, African-Americans see a better way to work with the Obama administration than they do with the Romney administration."</p>
    <p>Matt Borges, executive chairman of the Ohio GOP, could not name any specific outreach to black voters. Tara Wall, who handles African-American outreach for the Romney campaign, suggested contacting the Ohio Black Republican Association, but neither the president nor past president of the group responded to phone calls or emails.</p>
    <p>Borges was not aware of the work done by a new political action committee, Republican Union PAC, which has put up anti-Obama billboards in black communities, including Detroit and Cleveland, in five swing states. "Obama supports gay marriage &amp; abortion. Do you?" the billboard says.</p>
    <p>Some black conservatives are more ambitious than the Republican establishment appears to be.</p>
    <p>"We want to peel away 20 to 25 percent of the black vote in the swing states," said Claver Kamau-Imani, an Austin, Texas-based Republican activist. Recently, with a number of high-profile conservative African-American religious leaders, he created "God Said," a campaign aimed at pushing black voters to reconsider their allegiance to the president.</p>
    <p>"God Said" has produced a 30-second spot that Kamau-Imani said would air 50 times in the next week in Columbus on the BET cable network. "God said marriage equals one man and one woman," says a narrator over photos of a heterosexual African-American couple. "We agree. On Nov. 6, use your right to vote his values."</p>
    <p>Kamau-Imani said the group would also buy airtime in cities in three other toss-up states: Tallahassee, Fla., Norfolk, Va., and Milwaukee.</p>
    <p>The efforts of "God Said" are minuscule compared with the nonstop barrage of other political advertising on Ohio's airwaves. But its message is reinforced by other conservative black groups, such as the Frederick Douglass Foundation, a conservative Christian advocacy group in Virginia, and the Atlanta-based Coalition of African-American Pastors, which opposes same-sex marriage and works closely with the National Organization for Marriage.</p>
    <p>Last Tuesday, two CAAP officials were in Cleveland at the Williams Temple Church of God in Christ, a Pentecostal church, working out details for a news conference and Bible teach-in Thursday. The Rev. William Owens said the group hoped to capitalize on the media focus on Ohio to spread its message that Obama "betrayed the black community by endorsing same-sex marriage."</p>
    <p>One observer thinks there could be some fallout for Obama.</p>
    <p>"I think it is possible that these messages might reduce the black vote for Obama on the margins," said John Green, director of the Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron. "Even so, the black vote will likely be 90 percent or more Democratic this year."</p>
    <p>Frederick Douglass Foundation founder Timothy Johnson conceded that some black voters were conflicted over whether to abandon the first black president.</p>
    <p>But, he added, "It only tugs at your heartstrings if race trumps faith," he said. "Do we stand by our faith, or do we stand by the color of his skin?"</p>

And then, at about the 3:20 mark, it happens: The music stops and there's Chomsky, who sips from his cup of tea, looks up and deadpans, \"Oppan Chomsky style.\"\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>By Tuesday afternoon, the MIT parody had been seen more than 500,000 times on YouTube, which, while impressive, is less than 1/10th as many times as the original, according to <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2f2012%2f10%2f29%2fmit-chomsky-style-best-gagnam-style-parody-yet_n_2040053.html%3fncid%3dedlinkusaolp00000003\">HuffPost College</a>.</p><p>&#13;\n\

Besides the video's star, fellow MIT student Richard Yoon and the MIT Korean Students Association, the video also features several varsity athletic teams, the MIT mascot, the school's Dean of Admissions, an a cappella group and more than a few surprisingly energetic professors, not to mention MIT's most famous educator, Chomsky.</p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>Turns out Alan was the only student in Copley High to score a perfect 36 this year on his ACT and he couldn't be more pleased. <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fcollegeapps.about.com%2fod%2ftheact%2ff%2fgoodactscore.htm\">According to collegeapps.com</a>, \"Anyone scoring a 34, 35 or 36 is among the top 1 percent of test-takers in the country.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\

    &#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>F-B Patch:\xC2\xA0</strong>What are your secrets to success?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Alan: </strong>I study hard, make sure I'm focused and I try not to get distracted. I avoid spending too much time on social networks and I never do my homework in front of the TV.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>F-B Patch: </strong>What did you do to prepare for the ACT?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Alan: </strong>It's helpful to do practice tests. I took previous year's tests and it helped, I also went to an ACT Prep class. I think I took five practice tests. When I took the actual test, it had similar questions and it helped that I was already used to the format. Plus I was able to time myself in the practice tests so I learned time management.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>F-B Patch: </strong>Can you describe what happened the morning you found out you got a perfect score?\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Alan: </strong>I woke up around a normal time and I knew the scores were coming out so I went to check. In my gut I had a tiny feeling I had the potential to get a 36. When I checked it and saw I actually got a 36 I was extremely happy and surprised. My parents were very proud of me. They pushed me to do the practice tests and were helpful in general.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>My family (Dad, Ming; Mom, Jenny; Brother, Kevin) has been really supportive of me. They're a big part of any success I've had and I thank them for that. I also have great friends and teachers, too.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>F-B Patch:</strong> Have you applied you been accepted to any colleges? What do you want to study?\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Alan: </strong>I want to major in economics and to go into business management. I haven't been accepted into any colleges yet, but I am interested in Ivy League.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>F-B Patch:</strong>\xC2\xA0What's something not many people know about you?</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Alan:</strong> Well a lot of people can't tell just by looking at me that I'm athletic (laughs). I'm the captain of the soccer team and I play tennis. I've also been president of my class since freshman year.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Congratulations, Alan! Best of luck this year!</p>\n\

    <p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>When we moved into our new home a year ago I was thrilled: Great town, great schools, great next door neighbors. Life was good. I did however begin to miss living in a traditional neighborhood. We live on a bust street and while I do like the constant hustle and bustle of that, I worried we wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t get to know our extended neighbors. I chalked it up to one of the few things I would have to give up living in our new house, could be worse.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xC2\xA0Life was moving along fairly well and we had a great relationship with our next door neighbors from day one. Soon, new neighbors moved in behind us and we started enjoying playing with their son, sharing a glass of wine and just hanging out. Soon I was introduced to another family on the other side of our block. A play date came next and then the idea of a block party. I thought at least there would be four families to anchor my attempt to create a neighborhood. I joined forces with my next door neighbor, made flyers and reached out to several other families on our block and down our street. The RSVP\xE2\x80\x99s came rolling in and I started getting very excited.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>As if it was all meant to be the pending hurricane held off, the skies were clear and the air warm. The kids helped with set up carefully placing their outdoor toys around the yard for their new friends to enjoy. \xC2\xA0Leaves were raked, the lawn was cut and we even managed to get the driveway safety net up for rolling balls or runaway toddlers. I used the sidewalk chalk to write a message of welcome to our new friends and my son offered up his birthday balloons for the party. Neighbors showed up with fun side dishes, kids came with bikes and scooters. The young and the not so young played, ate good food and got to know one another. I shook a lot of hands, asked for reminders of names several times and pointed out my house to my new friends feeling all the while very satisfied with my efforts to create a neighborhood on my busy street.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>The day turned to night, the younger kids went home for bed and an outdoor fire kept the older kids and adults happy for hours. I learned that my son has two neighborhood kids that would be attending Kindergarten with him next year, that my daughter is great at making a little ones feel comfortable with the big kids and that my neighbor who recently lost her husband is doing OK and still has her great sense of humor.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>When midnight rolled around (yes, midnight) and the last log fizzled out we packed it up and called it a day/night. And as the last guest waved goodbye and I repeated their names as not to forget I thought about the next block party with what would then be old friends and maybe even some new. I always thought the sign of a successful party was thinking about the next with eager anticipation. I can\xE2\x80\x99t wait to throw our next block party! \xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0</p>\n\

    <p>Halloween is fun and trick or treating for free candy, as any child will tell you, is just plain awesome. However, there are risks and we must do what we can to make the holiday as safe as possible for the little ghouls and ghosts roaming the neighborhoods.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Here are some safety tips from security consultant and <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fconcord.patch.com%2fblog_posts%2fhalloween-safety-tips-e84c115e\">Patch blogger David Cullen</a>. Check them out and go over the trick-or-treating safety  tips with any child heading out in search of candy tomorrow\xC2\xA0on Halloween. It will only take a  few minutes and could make a big difference.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>FOR TRICK-OR-TREATERS:</strong></p><p>1. Carry a flashlight and walk, don't run. </p><p>2. Stay on sidewalks; obey traffic signals. </p><p>3. Stay in familiar neighborhoods. </p><p>4. Don't cut across yards or driveways. </p><p>5. Wear a watch you can read in the dark. </p><p>6. Make sure costumes don't drag on the ground. </p><p>7. Shoes should fit (even if they don't go with your costume). </p><p>8. Avoid wearing masks while walking from house to house. </p><p>9. Carry only flexible knives, swords or other props. </p><p>10. (lf no sidewalk) walk on left side of the road facing traffic. </p><p>11. Wear clothing with reflective markings/tape. </p><p>12. Approach only houses that are lit. </p><p>13. Stay away from and don't pet animals you don't know.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>FOR PARENTS:</strong></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>1. Make sure your child eats dinner before setting out. </p><p>2. Children should carry quarters so they can call home or consider the pluses/minuses of a cell phone. </p><p>3. Ideally, an adult should accompany young children of any age. </p><p>4. If your children go on their own, be sure they wear a watch, preferably one that can be read in the dark. </p><p>5. lf you buy a costume, look for one made of flame- retardant material. </p><p>6. Older children should know where to reach you and when they need to be home. </p><p>7. You should know where they're going. </p><p>8. Although tampering is rare, tell children to bring candy home to be inspected before consuming anything. </p><p>9. Look at the wrapping carefully and toss out anything that looks suspect.</p><p><strong>FOR HOMEOWNERS </strong></p><p>1. Make sure your yard is clear of such things as ladders, hoses, dog leashes, flower pots, etc. that can trip young ones. </p><p>2. Pets get frightened on Halloween. Put them someplace to protect them from cars or inadvertently biting a trick-or-treater.</p><p>3.  Battery powered jack o'lantern candles are preferable to a real flame.  If you do use candles, place the pumpkin well away from were  trick-or-treaters will be walking or standing. Make sure paper or cloth  yard decorations won't be blown into a flaming candle. </p><p>4.  Healthy food alternatives for trick-or-treaters include pre-packaged  low-fat crackers with cheese or peanut butter filling, single-serve  boxes of cereal, packaged fruit rolls, mini boxes of raisins and  single-serve packets of low-fat popcorn that can be microwaved later.  Non-food treats: plastic rings, pencils, stickers, erasers, coins, etc. </p><p><strong>BEFORE TRICK OR TREATING: </strong></p><p>1.  Plan costumes that are bright and reflective. Make sure that shoes fit I  well and that costumes are short enough to prevent tripping,  entanglement or contact with flame. </p><p>2. Consider adding reflective tape or striping to costumes and trick-or-treat bags for greater visibility. </p><p>3.  Secure emergency identification (name, address, phone number)  discreetly within Halloween attire or on a bracelet. Not on the outside  of clothing where anyone can see it. </p><p>4. Because a mask can limit  or block eyesight, consider non-toxic and hypoallergenic makeup or a  decorative hat as a safe alternative. </p><p>5. When shopping for costumes, wigs and accessories purchase only those with a label indicating they are flame resistant. </p><p>6.  Think twice before using simulated knives, guns or swords. If such  props must be used, be certain they do not appear authentic and are soft  and flexible to prevent injury. </p><p>7. Obtain flashlights with fresh batteries for all children and their escorts. </p><p>8. Plan ahead to use only battery powered lanterns or chemical\xC2\xA0light sticks\xC2\xA0in place of candles in decorations and costumes. </p><p>9. This is also a great time to buy fresh batteries for your smoke alarms.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p><strong>Now that you's safe, have fun and take pictures! </strong></p><p>&#13;\n\

    <p>BTS Asset Management Inc. of Lexington claimed its investment program had &ldquo;no down years&rdquo; since its inception in January 1981.</p>
    <p>But the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission determined that ads touting the past performance were &ldquo;materially misleading&rdquo; because they failed to disclose that a &ldquo;significant number&rdquo; of clients experienced different results.</p>
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>The SEC hit BTS with a &#36;200,000 fine and censure, and required the firm to hire an independent compliance consultant to review the firm&rsquo;s policies and procedures.</p>
    <p>BTS agreed to settle the case without admitting wrongdoing.</p>
    <p>The company has about &#36;1.5 billion in assets under management and 14,000 client accounts as of May 2012, according to the SEC.</p>

    <p>According to the Securities and Exchange Commission\xE2\x80\x99s order, made public Wednesday, BTS from the 1990s to 2010 advertised that it had suffered \xE2\x80\x9Cno down years\xE2\x80\x9D in its high yield bond fund program since 1981. The claim was based on buy and sell orders by the firm on one of its funds, or on a composite of funds, the SEC alleged. </p>\n\
    <p>The firm was aware that half its clients had lost money in 2004, regulators alleged, and yet continued to market the funds as never having fallen in value. BTS neither admitted to nor denied the charges.</p>\n\
    <p>BTS, which manages about $1.5 billion in assets, agreed to hire an independent compliance consultant, in addition to paying tthe penalty. The firm also agreed to cease and desist from further violations of the securities rules.</p>\r\n\

    </p><p>But, at least for the Warren camp, that calculus changed Tuesday. Myers said the next 48 hours should be devoted to storm recovery. But after that? Game on.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\"Elizabeth believes that the final televised debate should occur,\" Myers wrote in a Tuesday statement, \"and we  have contacted the debate organizers and let them know she would be  available to participate on Thursday evening.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>As of late Tuesday night,\xC2\xA0power and phone issues linger in Lexington, where many trees and wires are still down and, according to NSTAR, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2foutage.nstar.com%2foutage%2f\">more than 2,300 customers were without power as of 9 p.m</a>.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\

    </p><p>Further, trash collection will continue on its \"holiday week\" schedule of a day later than the norm, and the local bus service,\xC2\xA0<a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2flexington.patch.com%2flistings%2flexpress\">Lexpress</a>,\xC2\xA0will be running, although detours on routes 1 and 5 are possible if roads have not been cleared, according to a town communication.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>More good news: Halloween's happening.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\

Regarding the latter, given the road and sidewalk conditions, officials are advising that \"parents should make sure trick-or-treaters are safe in the dark,\xC2\xA0and stay away from downed trees and wires.\"</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Hurricane Sandy felt like it was hitting hardest on Monday, Oct. 29, but the downed limbs, trees and wires continued to take a toll deep into Tuesday.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Reported power outages fluctuated some throughout the day, but the number was consistently above 2,000, according to NSTAR's outage map.

    </p><p>Then, and now, it's important to remember to avoid downed wires and consider them all to be live. And, one more time, here's a few numbers to remember as phone and power problems persist:\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ul><li><strong>Call NStar at 800-592-2000\xC2\xA0</strong>for non-emergency outages, downed wires\xC2\xA0</li>&#13;\n\

    <p>State Representative Cory Atkins,&nbsp;a Concord Democrat who believes the state is doing a lot of things right, is seeking a seventh term in a race against Republican challenger Michael J. Benn,&nbsp;who says the one-party control on Beacon Hill has government &ldquo;out of balance.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Atkins, 65, and Benn, 47, are vying to represent the 14th Middlesex District, which covers all of Concord and Carlisle, and parts of Acton and Chelmsford.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Benn, who grew up in Concord, has served on the town&rsquo;s Public Ceremonies and Celebrations Committee,&nbsp;is active in the Knights of Columbus and in his church, where he taught Catholic religious education, and spent time coaching his children&rsquo;s youth soccer teams.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>After graduating from Northeastern University and earning a master&rsquo;s degree in business administration from Boston University, he spent his career working in health care finance, Benn said. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a total product of the private sector,&rdquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Benn said he views government from the perspectives of a parent, student, taxpayer, and someone who has worked in business for 24 years.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;These are the customers of government, and the customer should always be right,&rdquo; he said, adding that state government has lost sight of this.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Benn said the primary reason he&rsquo;s running is to get those who are &ldquo;stuck in the unemployment cycle&rdquo; back to work and to boost the economy. <span>&ldquo;These are real people with real needs who need good food on their plate and a good roof over their head,&rdquo; he said.</span>
    
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Bringing the state income tax rate and sales tax back down to 5 percent is a good starting point in restoring a thriving state economy, he said.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>He emphasized that he does not advocate for a lower tax rate to simply &ldquo;put a few more dollars in my pocket,&rdquo; but to provide the economic stimulus necessary for small businesses to thrive and create jobs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Many people who live near the New Hampshire border, and many from the 14th Middlesex District, drive over the state line to avoid the 6&frac14; percent sales tax in Massachusetts.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;When that happens, the state loses revenue from the whole sale,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Businesses lose sales and unemployment goes up.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>The second thing on Benn&rsquo;s economic agenda is to get spending under control.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Legislators should take the same approach to creating a budget as people in the private sector, which is to start at zero and require those requesting funds to justify each dollar being asked for, Benn said. 
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;We all maybe do more than we would have liked to do with less money than we would have liked to do it with,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But the job gets done.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Benn said if legislators worked together on Beacon Hill as well as individuals do in the private sector, things in government would get done more efficiently. &ldquo;But some people are doing things for their own political gain,&rdquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Atkins, who was first elected to Beacon Hill in a special election in 1999, said the state&rsquo;s economy is a lot better than in many parts of the country.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;Our bond rating is double A plus, one of only three states with that rating, we are ranked first in education .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and our rainy day fund is over $1 billion,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That gives us a real advantage in attracting business and creating jobs.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Atkins said that while the state has an innovative economy, it also has a cold climate, which can be a turnoff for companies looking for a place to locate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;But what attracts businesses here is our quality of life and our education system,&rdquo; she said.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>She said legislation passed during the last session, including health care cost containment, a jobs bill, and a move to streamline the permitting process for companies to build here, will help spur growth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>But another key issue, Atkins said, is public transportation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>She said the approximately $20 billion deficit in that department is something that can no longer be pushed aside, and balancing the budget &ldquo;is going to take a large, dedicated revenue stream.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>She said her first priority will be to make sure the concerns of the people in her district are represented, but that she is not ruling out voting in favor of a tax increase or new revenue stream that would specifically be used to balance the transportation budget.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a grown-up,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Santa Claus is not going to appear and fix this. I wish he were, but we are going to have to fix this and we are going to have to pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="articlePluckHidden">
    <p>Another thing Atkins says needs fixing is campaign finance laws that allow companies to pour unlimited amounts of money directly into political advertisements.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="">
    <p>Atkins sponsored legislation calling for lawmakers in Washington to respond to a US Supreme Court ruling that allows for the unfettered corporate contributions.

  title: Ryan Conte stands out amid Somerville's struggles

    <p>SOMERVILLE &mdash; These are the dog days for Somerville High football.</p>
    <p>The team is struggling along with an 0-7 record and prospects don&rsquo;t look good with No. 2 Everett on the horizon for this weekend. There is ample opportunity for senior lineman Ryan Conte to become a clubhouse cancer and bemoan his fate while others throughout the commonwealth are enjoying their moments in the spotlight.</p>
    <p>But that wouldn&rsquo;t be Conte. The 6-foot-4, 250-pounder arrives at practice 20-30 minutes early every day and remains the hardest worker in the program.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very dedicated, worked out twice daily in the offseason to become a better player,&rdquo; said Somerville coach Tony Gulla, who returned to coach the Highlanders after spending the past eight seasons as an assistant at Olympia High in Orlando, Florida. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a leader and does everything we ask of him.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>A lifelong resident of Somerville, Conte was talked into playing football by John Wallace. A fellow lineman who earned a scholarship to UMass, Conte credits Wallace with making him the player he is today.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Me and John are really good friends going all the way back to hockey, and he&rsquo;s the one who convinced me to play football,&rdquo; Conte said. &ldquo;We still talk all the time. He tells me to be cool, be patient and work hard because good things will happen to me.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Wallace speaks from experience. Like Conte, he experienced very little success in terms of wins and losses, but his skills were too hard to overlook as evidenced by the scholarship. Gulla has coached his share of quality linemen in nearly 25 years, and says Conte could be the second best lineman he&rsquo;s coached behind Gosder Cherilus, now starting for the Detroit Lions.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to say he&rsquo;s as good as Gosder,&rdquo; Gulla said, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s as good as anyone else I&rsquo;ve had. When I was coaching in Florida, we had a lineman (Shawn Curtis) who has 20 Division 1 offers right now, and I&rsquo;d put Ryan right there with him. He does everything you want an offensive lineman to do &mdash; finishes his blocks, gets right up on them and pancakes them.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Some lucky program is going to get a diamond in the rough.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Conte received some interest from UMass and UNH along with some of the Ivy League schools. Conte knows full well that the interest might have been greater if he played elsewhere, but he wouldn&rsquo;t trade his high school experience for anything, regardless of overall records.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;This is my home. I grew up in Somerville and always wanted to play for Somerville High School,&rdquo; Conte said. &ldquo;I want to keep playing hard, trying to motivate everyone to keep pushing for that first win.&rdquo;</p>

    </p><p><em>The following letter was send to parents on Oct. 31 by Superintendent Anne Wilson:</em></p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Dear SPS Parents and Guardians:</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>I am happy to report that school will be open tomorrow, November 1,  2012. Please be aware that there continue to be blocked roads and  hazards in certain areas around Sudbury. Currently Town Internet is not  working due to a fallen tree near the Flynn building and therefore an  update on closed roads is not available online. Work to repair the fiber  lines was in process today and will continue tomorrow.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>As  of this evening, NSTAR is still working on problem areas and Sudbury  Fire/Police Department personnel have informed us that the area around  each individual school is clear but that the following problem areas  exist:</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Peakham Road from French to Southwest Circle (Crews were working on this area this evening)</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ul><li>French Road from Peakham to Red Horse Path</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>Dudley Road from Tippling Road to Nobscott</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>The area around Thunder Road, Sunset, and Silver Hill</li>&#13;\n\
    <li>The area around Candy Hill and Plympton Road</li>&#13;\n\
    </ul><p>Please  remind your children to observe all yellow caution tape areas and be  aware that hazards may still exist, especially in the areas described in  this message.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>We  anticipate that bus service may be delayed somewhat due to the  necessity for alternate paths to bus stops. The SPS central office  phones and Internet access were not in service this evening due to the  work on the damaged fiber lines at Flynn. We hope that repairs will be  final tomorrow.\xC2\xA0<strong>If you experience a problem with bus service tomorrow, please call the SPS bus lot at <a>978-443-8631</a>.</strong>\xC2\xA0The  bus company has assured us that they expect to be able to make all  stops, but with potential delays in problem areas that may still exist  in he morning.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Thank  you for your patience and your understanding that we have been working  hard to ensure student safety and bring you the most current  information.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Anne S. Wilson,<br>Superintendent of Schools</p>\n\

The centerpiece of Brown\xE2\x80\x99s healthcare  policy is working to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the federal healthcare reform law known as ObamaCare.</p><p>National healthcare advocacy organization Community Catalyst Action  Fund released a new analysis finding that, if the Affordable Care Act  (\xE2\x80\x9CObamaCare\xE2\x80\x9D) is repealed, senior citizens in Sudbury and across  Massachusetts will be saddled with higher costs and fewer benefits.</p><p>ObamaCare, as it is known, lowers seniors\xE2\x80\x99 Medicare premiums and  out-of-pocket costs by an estimated $500 per year. This means that, if  Republican Scott Brown gets his way and repeals ObamaCare, seniors\xE2\x80\x99  Medicare costs will go up about $5,000 over the next decade.</p><p>ObamaCare also fills in the so-called \xE2\x80\x9Cdonut hole\xE2\x80\x9D in prescription  drug coverage for seniors.\xC2\xA0 Between January and August of this year,  31,000 Massachusetts residents hit the \xE2\x80\x9Cdonut hole.\xE2\x80\x9D\xC2\xA0 ObamaCare saved  those Medicare beneficiaries an average of over $600 per person.\xC2\xA0 This  means that, if Republican Scott Brown gets his way and repeals  ObamaCare, seniors\xE2\x80\x99 prescription drug costs will go up dramatically.</p><p>Also, during the first eight months of 2012, over 500,000 Medicare  beneficiaries across Massachusetts took advantage of no-cost preventive  services thanks to ObamaCare. If Republican Scott Brown gets his way  and repeals ObamaCare, seniors will lose these no-cost preventive  services.</p><p>Policy decisions made in Washington, D.C., have a real and direct  impact on the residents of Sudbury.

    <p>Since today is Halloween, there's no better topic to turn to than ... candy.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>I inherited a sweet tooth from both my grandmothers. Nana always had a white porcelain candy jar in her hutch, and a glass bowl on the coffee table, hiding treats like mini Reese's cups or dark chocolates. Grandma loved hard candies \xE2\x80\x94 suckers \xE2\x80\x94 but also had a tin of Snickers, Milky Way and other chocolate treats on hand.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>So today I thank both of them for my love of candy!</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>As a kid, trick-or-treating was exciting and fun, but perhaps the best part was getting home after and sitting at the kitchen table with my sister to sort and count our bounty. There were trades made, raisins given to my mom and tins stacked with mini candy bars to be rationed out over the coming weeks.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>It's hard to pick just five favorite Halloween trick-or-treat staples, but here goes:</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><ul><li><strong>M&amp;Ms: </strong>Always a favorite of mine. I love peanut M&amp;Ms, but due to their size, there are fewer than in a fun sized pack of plain M&amp;Ms. But I've never seen an M&amp;M I don't like, especially with all the fun flavors now made.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>Candy corn:</strong> I like biting off each colored layer, starting with the white tip, and making my way down the kernel. The candy corns that end with a chocolate layer are wonderful, and I'm also quite fond of the pumpkins.</li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>Snickers: </strong>A classic. Chocolate, nougat, peanuts, caramel. What's not to love? </li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>Crunch:</strong> I wasn't always a fan of these when I was younger, but came around to the delicious chocolate and crisp rice combo later in life. </li>&#13;\n\
    <li><strong>Charleston Chew:</strong> These were a staple of my Halloween bags of yore. Chewy and elastic provided for a fun eating experience. And frozen Charleston Chews are a pleasant treat as well. </li>&#13;\n\
    </ul><p>I still need to hit the store to buy candy to hand out. Bought any earlier in the week or month, Halloween candy would stand no chance of making it to Oct. 31. There's still a chance it won't make it to 6 p.m. If you're still needing to pick up candy, I bet <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwayland.patch.com%2flistings%2fcvs-125\">CVS</a> or <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwayland.patch.com%2flistings%2fdonelans-supermarket\">Donelan's</a> still has a supply left.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>I know there are many other candies I left off the list. Tell me, <strong>what's your favorite Halloween candy? </strong>What are you hoping to rob from your kid's stash? And kids, what do you hope your neighbors are handing out?</p>\n\

  content: "<div><div><p>Massachusetts Vest-a-Dog 2013 Calendar is now available for a $10 donation, online and at select locations including Especially for Pets at 44 Main ST, Wayland.\xC2\xA0 Proceeds from the calendars will support Massachusetts police dogs, by helping provide bulletproof vests, essential equipment, and funding for training and the purchase of dogs for K-9 work.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Preview the calendar and see the complete list of businesses where the calendar is available on the organization\xE2\x80\x99s website, <a href=\"http://viewtext.org/article?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.mavestadog.org\">www.mavestadog.org</a>.\xC2\xA0</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>This is the seventh calendar offered by the non-profit, and the second exclusively featuring the work of photographer Jonathan Kozowyk, whose extraordinary efforts successfully captured K-9s (and their handlers) at work.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CYour donation of $10 for a calendar truly helps make a difference to these hard-working dogs, who provide tremendously valuable services to keep our communities safe.\xC2\xA0 Donations of any amount, as well as volunteer assistance, is welcome,\xE2\x80\x9D notes Kathy Hinds, Massachusetts Vest-a-Dog President.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CSince 2000, we\xE2\x80\x99ve provided over 320 bulletproof vests, including twenty SWAT K9 vests at $2400 each, across the state.\xC2\xA0 With our expanded mission, we\xE2\x80\x99ve been able to offer more support for K9 programs, with over $35,000 in grants to local police and county sheriff departments, as well as the Massachusetts State Police, providing K-9 first aid kits, cruiser kennels, HOTnPOP (cruiser over-heat-detector/alarm and door-popper systems) and bite sleeves/suits.\xC2\xA0 We provided a grant to help fund a K9 training conference attended by 65 handlers, and awarded $12,500 to help implement K9 programs in Blackstone, Douglas, Holliston, Salem, and Marlboro.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>All proceeds remain in-state, solely supporting Massachusetts K9 programs.\xC2\xA0 The organization is a 501(c)3 non-profit; donations are tax-deductible as allowed by the IRS.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Diane Whittaker, Vice President of Massachusetts Vest-a-Dog explains, \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s exciting to be able to extend our support for our 4-legged officers.\xC2\xA0 For example, we\xE2\x80\x99re glad to have provided another tool to help insure the safety of a K-9; a HOTnPOP system for a K9 cruiser, after learning the cruiser\xE2\x80\x99s radiator hose had failed \xE2\x80\x93 causing the engine to blow hot air, instead of air-conditioned-cooled air on a hot day, a potentially fatal situation.\xC2\xA0 Now if the interior temperature exceeds an acceptable level, the cruiser\xE2\x80\x99s lights and horn are activated, windows roll down, and the beeper worn on the handler\xE2\x80\x99s duty belt will activate, as well.\xE2\x80\x9D</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>\xE2\x80\x9CThese dogs are a vital necessity to law enforcement, keeping our communities safe, bringing home lost family members, tracking/apprehending suspects, sniffing out drugs, locating evidence on a track, and more.\xC2\xA0 They clearly love their job.\xC2\xA0 It\xE2\x80\x99s an honor and joy to volunteer with Massachusetts Vest-a-Dog, as it\xE2\x80\x99s given me more opportunities to help these outstanding police dogs,\xE2\x80\x9D\xC2\xA0 affirms Whittaker, a Certified Veterinary Technician for 26-plus years (20 at New England Animal Medical Center in West Bridgewater).</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Also featured in the Massachusetts Vest-a-Dog 2013 calendars are K-9 teams from Ashland, Westford, Newton and Barnstable Police Departments, Essex County Sheriff\xE2\x80\x99s Department, Massachusetts State Police and Veterans Administration-Bedford. Besides calendars, other merchandise is also available on the website:\xC2\xA0 Tshirts, hats, dog tags, travel mugs and window decals.</p><p>&#13;\n\
    </p><p>Donations may be sent directly to Massachusetts Vest-a-Dog, Inc, PO BOX 48 Walpole MA\xC2\xA0 02081.\xC2\xA0 For more information, please call 508-668-7149 or visit their website at www.mavestadog.org</p></div></div>"
