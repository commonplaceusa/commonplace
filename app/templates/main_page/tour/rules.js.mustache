      <li>
        <p><strong>Be yourself.</strong> You are your real self on OurCommonPlace. Community works because you're accountable for what you say, and you can't be accountable if you're hiding behind anonymity</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Give, don't take.</strong> This is about getting connected with your neighbors, not using your neighbors. Don't just take -- give as well. If you want to get more people to buy your products and services, go through the appropriate channels by "Registering a Community Feed." Save other sections for authentic, non-commercial neighborhood connection.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Stay neighborly.</strong> Town debates might get heated and you might feel like some of your neighbors are a bit kooky. Be as passionate as you want about town issues -- speak your mind -- but we simply can't have personal attacts or mean-spirittedness on OurCommonPlace.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>A good rule of thumb is:</strong> <em>don't say anything you wouldn't feel comfortable saying to someone's face, in front of everyone else in town.</em></p>
