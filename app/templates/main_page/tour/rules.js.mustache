    <p>To keep our community strong, we encourage three norms:</p>
    <ol id="rules">
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/shared/redesign/norms-1.png" alt="Be Yourself" title="Be Yourself" />
        <p><strong>1. Be yourself.</strong> Use your real name. Add a photo so people can recognize you!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/shared/redesign/norms-2.png" alt="Give, don't just take" title="Give, don't just take" />
        <p><strong>2. Help others.</strong> Try to give your neighborhood great things as much as you ask for them. If want to grow your business, you need to register a community page <a href="/feed_registrations/new" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/shared/redesign/norms-3.png" alt="Stay neighborly" title="Stay neighborly" />
        <p><strong>3. Stay neighborly.</strong> Please, please be kind to your neighbors!<br/>Avoid saying anything you wouldn't feel comfortable saying in person.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
