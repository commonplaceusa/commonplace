  subject: Posting of flyers in the Village of Warwick
  body: |-
    I'd like to propose an equal opportunity solution to posting flyers .
    Allow public postings 2 weeks prior to the event.  Allow 48 hours to fully remove them.  Those who don't comply , would be subject to a fine.
    Posting of flyers , while seemingly "unsightly" to others, actually helps stimulate local business, supports community events and promotes community awareness for those who aren't computer savvy.  Your thoughts?
    Thank you.

    What are some of your favorite places to take toddlers in Raleigh?  We recently discovered the play area at North Hills Mall, which was a hit with my one-year old (and I'm a huge 
     fan of free things).  It's nothing fancy, just foam pads and blocks for the little ones to play on under a shade tent, open M-F from 9-1.  http://bit.ly/ipZEOz 
    
    Where else do you take your kids?

  subject: Parking in Downtown Raleigh
  body: I've heard lots of different points of view on this subject, mainly about those who want parking downtown to be the same as in the burbs, i.e. readily available, close to their destination, and without charge.  Raleigh's downtown is currently going through a redevelopment phase, where parking options are intentionally constrained (ordinances, development restrictions) so that available land in the downtown area can be used more effectively.  While this make sense in the long term, the lack of alternative modes of transportation to driving are causing short term concerns for downtown residents and visitors alike.  I'd like to start a discussion to share thoughts about this issue?

It's a raised bed garden with a mix of topsoil, sand, compost & manure & vegetable fertilizer. Since last week's planting, some of the tomato and basil plants have gotten yellowed or brown leaves and some of the peppers have just dropped their leaves. What did I do wrong? Other plants in the garden (herbs, cucumber, other tomatoes and peppers) are doing just fine. Any thoughts? "

    Jeff Swift passed on this great resource to me, which I am now passing on to you! The North Carolina Department and Agriculture & Consumer Services offers free soil testing in our area! This is especially important when starting a new garden. It's as simple as sending in a small sample of the soil from your future (or present) garden site.
    Here's a link to the article: http://www.raleighpublicrecord.org/news/2011/05/03/test-that-soil-raleigh-gardeners/

It is important to consider the wildlife in the area. The most common preditors that present a threat to chickens are: Raccoon, Dog, Coyote, Fox, Opossum, Rat, Owl, Bobcat, Hawk, and Snake. \n\n\
    Predator proofing balances safety and gives freedom for the chickens and other domestic fowl who need every opportunity to exercise at their free will and natural instincts. They are here at our whim and we are responsible for keeping them safe. \n\n\
    Have our neighbors who wish to bring chickens close to parks and schools considered this risk? Are government and school officials prepared to preditor proof parks and school yards when these preditors are drawn into the populated areas? "

  subject: Single Mom of 2 Needs Room/Apt in Exchange for Any Kind of Work
  body: "Hi, I am a single mom with 2 young kids and we are in need of a place to live, but I'm having a hard time figuring out how to juggle a job and childcare, which can be very expensive. Our dream come true would be to find someone with a room, rooms, or small apartment on a farm or something similar, which we could live in for full or partial rent in exchange for any kind of work. Would accept any living situation as long as you don't mind us there, even if it's just one room. Would be willing to do farm work, manual labor, gardening, yardwork, housekeeping, pet chores, childcare, elder care, or anything similar. I am a fast learner and don't balk at any kind of work. I homeschool my oldest child so would be willing to help teach yours if you are a homeschooling family. I have a very modest income from selling items online on Etsy and I will be receiving child support, but could really use a setup like this to help make ends meet. If you or anyone you know could help me out, please email me at barefootpoetry@yahoo.com. We are a nice young family and may be bringing our cat with us, so pet-friendly is a must. Thanks in advance for any and all help! "

  subject: Cancer Fundraiser - Opportunities to Help!
  body: |-
    Hi! I'm organizing a sweet fundraiser to benefit lung cancer awareness. It's called Cupcakes For A Good Cause, and you can read more about it at www.cupcakesforagoodcause.com. I am looking for some talent to help out with the event. I need a couple of 'celebrity' judges - people well-known in the community who might like to take a bite out of 20-ish cupcakes and pick a winner! Any suggestions on who I should ask?
    I am also hoping to find an emcee who would be willing to donate their time to the cause (we would of course list them as an event sponsor).
    And, of course, we need bakers! If you are interested in entering your cupcakes into the contest (both amateur and professional welcome!) go to our site, where you can read the rules and register online. www.cupcakesforagoodcause.com
    Thanks!

  body: |-
    Hi guys,
    I'm putting together an informal "survival guide" for some family members who are moving to Marquette under some tough financial circumstances. I did survive some lean years in town during college, so I have something of a grasp on cheap food, activities, etc., but I'd love others' input too. What's the best deal or money-saving strategy you have? Where's the best place to eat cheap? How should new residents prepare for winter on a budget? Please feel free to post publicly -- I'm sure this is information many could use :)

Any thoughts? I tried a Wheatgrass conditioner and soothing Shampoo to help and the vet recommended Benadryl. Anyone else experiencing this?

    The second is a similar organization started by concerned teachers: http://www.saveourschoolsmarch.org/ Under "About" see "Guiding Principles."

  body: Additional Respite Volunteers are needed in the Owosso and Corunna communities.  There are volunteer trainings scheduled in Oct. and Nov.  Most volunteers visit 1-3 hours a week.  For extenuating patient and family caregiver circumstances, sometimes volunteers visit for 4 hours.  Volunteers are matched with one person, and many volunteers become great friends with the person and caregiving family they serve.

  body: "At the city candidate forum everyone agreed that it is hard to \"get the word out\" on Clarkston events and activities. Creating a large bulletin board right in front of city hall--with organized sections on various events might be the answer. It could cost as little as $50 and with a good overhang, could be outside without much damage. If anyone else is interested in helping with this--let me know and I'll start working on it. "

  subject: How can we improve the services offered by our Chelmsford public library ?
  body: |-
    Public libraries are funded by our town - so we pay for this service. It is one of the best kept secrets of america. It is generally quite expensive to keep running a public library. It makes sense for any town to devote resources towards library if the residents well utilize the public library.
    
    I feel library resources are not fully utilized by residents of the town. On several occasions I tried to initiate a few discussions with library staff and those conversation went no where. I thought of using this new online forum to collectively gather useful opinions and feedback to present them to library/town officials.
    
    If you are not using library - what are the reasons for this ?
    
    If you are already a patron - what are the type of services you would like to see our library should offer ?
    
    Thank you.

  body: |-
    Approximately 15 years ago we moved to Burnsville because it provided us with an affordable home (compared to South Minneapolis), and we liked School District 191.  Wondering what motivated other residents to do the same.  Was there any one or two things that really "sealed the deal" for you?    What keeps you here? 
    
    I would love to hear from others.  Especially those that have moved here in the past five or so years.

  body: |+
    OCFCA will host a presentation by Jim Ostrowski, an environmental quality anylyst with the Office of Environmental Assistance, Michigan Dept. of Environmental Quality(DEQ), at 7:pm November 10 in the Robert Kolenski Hall(lower level accessible by elevator) of St. Paul Church in Owosso, 111N Howell Street.
    Those attending should enter the Howell Street door, turn right and proceed downstairs to the hall.  There will be guides to direct you to the elevator, if necessary.
    Mr Ostrowski will provide an overview of the environmental and health concerns related to outdoor burning, as well as how outdoor burning is regulated in Michigan and options that  local governments have to address burning in their community.
    There will also be information with resources which are available in the area for recycling of refuse, leaves, sticks and twigs.
    The OCFCA knows that there is no constitutional "right to burn" and since burning or polluting of any resource effects everyone,
    the "right to breathe" unpolluted air takes precedence.
    Everyone is affected but those who have immediate health problems suffer most.  We hope to educate citizens to see that outdoor burning hurts all-some with future consequences and some in the present with health problems. 
    Come learn and join us for the future of Owosso.
    Question/Answers will be included.  Refreshments will be served.
    For more information call Shelah Hockman at 723-2102 or e-mail sdab2345@frontier.com or respond here.

  body: |-
    Join Clarkston's country music songfest, Goatville Jam, this Thursday, November 3.  Goatville Jam is a monthly gathering of pickers and vocalists interested in playing old country music (think Hank Williams, George Jones, Emmylou Harris). We meet on the first Thursday each month at the Clarkston Community Center. Set your GPS to 955 North Indian Creek Drive, Clarkston, GA 30021. Follow the deck to the CCC Angora Room front right. 
    
    Tuneup starts at 7:00pm, and the jam runs 7:30pm - 9:30pm. If you are interested in picking and/or singing, please contact Wade Medlock at 209-663-4566. We collect $5 per head for musicians and audience members for the generous use of the historic Community Center.
    
    We have enjoyed various combinations of guitars, banjos, basses, mandolins, harmonicas, pedal steel guitars, accordion and vocals. Bring your favorite pickin' chair, if you prefer. The Community Center provides padded-seat folding chairs. 
    
    We'll try to help new pickers learn the songs...then trade leads around the room. If you prefer just to strum rhythm, that's fine, too. Teach us your stuff: feel free to bring 10 copies of lead sheets to some of your favorite country songs to share, and we'll give them a try.
    
    Rhythm pickers stay acoustic; lead pickers and bass can bring amps (bring a long extension cord).
    
    Audience members are always welcome.

  body: After reading the article in Burnsville This Week regarding the spike in violence and rapes in Burnsville (quoting Burnsville's Head of Police)I am wondering just how many group homes are there in Burnsville?  What types of group homes are there? What are the rules governing any limits on Group Homes? etc.Are there Group homes for juvenile offenders and what schools are they attending? Lots and lots of questions-especially with the open housing stock available right now in Burnsville.

  body: "\n\
    I just find it scary that anyone with kids they love & want to keep safe would take their kids around for the most part to complete strangers houses and ask for candy, let alone dressed up crazier than a nut house resident. when they truly have no clue if these people are nuts or not, or if the candy is tainted and parents be honest it's not like you even come close to testing 1% of any thing they get if at all. and y\xE2\x80\x99all take completely on assumption that it's OK & safe to do, do you really know your nabs around you probably not that well at all. and my reasons for not being involved in the practice of it.\n\
    1. originally it is an ancient pagan astrological ritualistic belief & worship of witchcraft & many other deistic beliefs such as white & black magic practice, earth worship, druidism, and many other occult beliefs. \n\
    2. (the trust factor) not that you shouldn't trust some people with some things, but not your kids and I should not dare to put the health of my kids in anyone eles's hands as much as I humanly can & is silly to think that everyone else has the same idea of well being & safety I do for my kids.\n\
    3. I'm not a theist of any kind.\n\
    4.I'm educated in the history of of our world and it's many belief systems past and present.\n\
    4. I use common sense, critical thinking & logical reasoning in the parenting & teaching of my kids and with my own life.\n\
    5. I choose not to lie to my children about any subject that may or may not have as they grow up any affect on them and the proper education they will need to survive in this world.\n\
    6. it is intellectually immoral to not teach our kids our true history of any & all kinds as far back as we can to learn & so as not to repeat our mistakes.\n\
    7. and diabetes is already a problem in the US.\n\
    and with saying this I have no reason to lie and only have my communities safety & education in mind.\n\
    sorry if some of the spelling is wrong working and posting so was done fast thanks T.\n"

  subject: Regarding Group Homes In Burnsville
  body: I know I see the Mayor and most City Council members on this website. Now today's 11/2 Star Tribune also reference BPD Bob Hawkins report.  Instead of cutting back on any police services we had better put more resources towards crime prevention and I am greatly concerned about the number of (and what appears to be concentrated areas)group homes. If we can pay people to go around snapping photos of resident's "unsheltered"trash cans lets put additional resources towards police protection.

  body: |-
    The concept is not new however my idea has been said to have merit. 
    
    My idea is to reduce marketing costs for local business owners struggling from the recession by using low-cost technology to drive sales and create unlimited exposure to local products and services. At the same time, it can provide a reliable, uncluttered, and organized marketplace for local consumers to browse and even shop online. Keywords: "reliable, uncluttered, and organized"
    
    There's so much more I can post about but what do you think? 
    
    Please refer to MQT247.com or feel free to ask me any questions. Thank you for your input, in advance.

  body: Just moved to Chelmsford and love the town.  One problem...we don't have a dining room set and it doesn't feel like home yet.  We are interested in finding a used set...something light, maybe oak or maple...something light rather than heavy...open to any quality pieces.  Thought someone might be looking to sell their dining set.  Thanks!

  body: I've been doing genealogy for over 20 yrs., and for 10 yrs. on-line.    And, I'm very active  at   www.rootsweb.com   and  www.genforum.com   etc.      When I talk to people while doing errands,  I find out many people don't start genealogy because they think it is too expensive.    That is wrong.   There are at least a dozen, different ways to do your research which don't cost money. ..   And, there is a Chelmsford Genealogy Club,  and some don't know there is a Greater Lowell Genealogy Group - which meets on Sat. afternoons at different libraries.  ...    Billerica's history is just as important as Chelmsford's history  (both inc. in 1655), so I've always wondered why there wasn't a  Billerica Genealogy Club.    ..  But, what I've wanted for 10 yrs. is a ..morning..  group.    My suggestion?    Billerica and Chelmsford Genealogy In the Morning !       ....    I have 2 ancestors who were involved with the early 1600's in Billerica,  James KIDDER and Simon CROSBY,  and then son, John KIDDER, was an early settler in Chelmsford.

  subject: Manufactured Housing Community
  body: |
    Just curious how many people in town realize that the "manufactured housing community" is .NOT. "low-income housing?" Do you know that the majority of the residents have to pay probably close to $1,500 per month to live there? If the residents have a mortgage to pay, that and the Park Rent add up to about $1,000 per month. And, then the residents have to pay for their own .heat.. and all utilities. And, do they get any .. respect? 
    
    
    The .Comunity. has been referred to by many names since the 1950's. And, it started out with maybe a dozen units back then. But, now there are well over 200 units. And, because it is "private property," the residents don't have many of the benefits of other home-owners in Chelmsford.      The "seniors" living there don't get senior-citizen benefits, and everyone living there who owns their unit, has to buy "home-owners insurance"  just like all home-owners in town.

  subject: Need for a "Shelter"  when we lose electricity
  body: |+
    It was mentioned in the "Sun" last week that it is not good that Chelmsford doesn't have it's own "shelter" for the use of residents who lose electricity and heat during bad storms.     We were told that we had to go to the "Lowell Senior Center" for help.    How many in need of help would go to the Lowell Senior Center, and how many know where it is located?     And, how many seniors in Chelmsford would drive to that part of Lowell ?
    
    I heard that the Chelmsford Senior Center had also lost electricity, and probably the Town Hall and all the schools, etc.    But, there must be a building in town -  which didn't lose electricity.      I would suggest the Chelmsford Elks but I believe they also lost electricity.     On the .news.  it said that 80% of the town lost electricity,   so maybe there weren't any public buildings to use -  but what about large restaurants?
    
    I'm curious how the officials at Town Hall handled the needs of all the residents living in  "senior housing"  during the power outage.      Just a reminder that most .seniors.  get cold much easier than younger adults.     And, many don't have extra food in their apartment.    And they couldn't go to the Senior Center for lunch,  and probably  "Meals on Wheels" wasn't available.
    
    And, once the Stop & Shop in the Center closes this week,  they won't be able to .walk.   to a supermarket.     And, the residents of "senior housing" in North Chelmsford don't have a supermarket they can .walk.  to.
    
    And, if all those residents were advised to go to the Lowell Senior Center for shelter,   were the  "senior buses"  made available to them?

  subject: "\"Nursing Facilities\" in Town"
  body: |+
    I'm curious if residents have comments to offer about the several "nursing facilities" in town   (aka Nursing Homes).     About 10 yrs. ago an aunt in Chelmsford needed to go to one,  and one was found in Lowell.    The first one was terrible, and I filed a complaint.    (You should see it now!)    The second one was much better.     Up to this year, a relative had knee surgery, and needed a Rehab to go to after he left the hospital.     Even though he lives in NH,  he went to a hospital in Lowell, and then was sent to a Rehab in Lowell.    This was a Rehab I wasn't aware of in a Nursing Facility.    He was not treated well,  and I didn't see any .happy faces. on the other Rehab patients staying there.     He went back to the hospital and then was sent to a much better one in Lowell.
    
    Some residents of the town go to a Nursing Facility in Westford.     I haven't heard any complaints about that one.    In fact,  there is more "senior housing" being built in Westford, along Rt. 110 -  just beyond Chelmsford.     I don't remember whether there is a "Westford Senior Center"  but that would have been a better location for people in Chelmsford to go to for .shelter.
    
    How many residents go to the Nursing Facilities in Billerica, instead?      How many know about the Nursing Facility in Billerica where  multiply-handicapped children live?
    
    How many .VISIT..   Nursing Facilities  and spend time with the patients who might not have other visitors?      The holidays are here !      How many of those patients sit by the doors to the outside -   hoping to see someone they know coming up the walkway?        
    
    (My husband needed an Outpatient Rehab one year ago,  and for his needs,  we had to drive to Haverhill several days a week.)

  body: "Hello.   How many .attempted.  to attend the preview of the Grand Opening of the Super Stop & Shop tonight?      We .attempted.  to get there.    But, from Chelmsford Center to that supermarket?    It took us over 45 min. -  bumper to bumper traffic the entire way.    When we finally got there, there wasn't a parking space in sight !    People had even parked on the side of the small road beside it, and it wouldn't surprise me to find out many had parked across the street in the Marketbasket parking lot.     We did get into the S&S parking lot but then noticed probably over 100 people standing in line waiting to get into the store.     No one was going in,  so they might have only allowed so many people at a time.     It was getting close to 6:30 pm when we were in front of the store, and it's chilly tonight.    So, we decided to leave.    Probably other people left - without even getting into the store.   ..   It was a waste of time, and a waste of our gasoline --  crawling up Rt.110 for 45 min.     "

  body: "Just curious how many know of a \"traffic problem\" in town which annoys you.    Are there major, traffic problems which you think need to be taken care of?     Or, are there minor, traffic problems  which you wish more people would know about?     One of my .daily.  aggravations is right in Chelmsford Center.    There are so many people -- running the red light --  when coming down Rt. 110 from Lowell and heading across towards the Library area !     I wish there was a .camera.  on that intersection to catch the drivers doing that !      I quite often get the Green light to go through the intersection towards Rt. 129 -  and I still have drivers going across in front of me.  ..   And, the drivers coming out of the little parking lot beside the .old.  Town Hall -  don't know what to do !     And, drivers who come into the intersection,  and want to take a left, onto that little side road where the \"Diner\" and \"Chelmsford shop\" is -- don't know what to do !   "

  subject: "\"Senior Housing\"  vs.  \"Low-Income Housing\""
  body: |+
    Hello.   In this morning's "Sun,"  I saw another ad where an office is saying that a "Low-Income Apt."  for  "people over 55"  is available for -- people who qualify for a mortgage.     This is one of my .political.  pet-peeves.     There are so many residents of town,  or in Greater Lowell,  who are definitely "low-income" residents.    And, I'll bet a great many of them can't afford the "low-income apartments" being offered for sale !     
    
    As I think I mentioned in another message,  many residents of Chelmsford .THINK.   the Mobile Home Park is -  "low income housing."     Do you know that residents there probably pay $1,500  per month to live there?
    
    We drive in Lowell often,  and my husband comments on how many "projects"  are in that city.     My comment is that it seems to be only "cities"  which have "projects" -  or housing for "really"  low-income people.

  subject: Driving and Parking in Chelmsford Center
  body: |
    Just curious how many people do not visit Chelmsford Center - because they don't like to drive through or into the Center,  or because they can never find a parking spot there.      I have asked Town Hall  to put in more "cross-walks" in the Center - for the safety of the people who park in the "public parking" lot behind the Sovereign Bank.    They said that a cross-walk there is .. not safe !    ... So then I say to myself --  WHY can't there be a "speed-limit"  directly in the Center ?    So many drivers, including drivers of  "big rigs" / "18-wheelers"  who "SPEED" through the Center !       :o(       Oh,  I should mention that I'm talking about the .tiny.  "Common"  at the intersection of Rt. 110, Rt. 4, Rt. 129, etc.     There are probably different "traffic and pedestrian problems surrounding the official "Town Common"  between the church and the fire station.

  subject: Need for a  "Soup Kitchen"  in Town  ?
  body: Hi again.   A few nights ago I watched one of those shows on TV where a man  (and his committee rebuild or build homes for needy people).   I don't remember which State they were in this time,  but they were rebuilding a home for a couple (family?)  who ran a "Soup Kitchen"  out of their home - for their town.     In this morning's "Sun,"  there is an article about the "Soup Kitchen" in Lowell.   ..   I'm curious whether there is a need for a "Soup Kitchen"  in Chelmsford.     Perhaps one could be created for  both Billerica and Chelmsford together.       I "know"  there needy people in both towns,  and probably many go to the Food Pantries.    ..   But, I also have been told that there are rules about making food - from your home -  to be served outside the home.    ..  I know there is a church in Chelmsford which offers a "free meal" one night a week.      Do residents of this town -  who have a good meal to eat every night know about all the residents of the town - who don't?

  subject: How Many Shop in Lowell and/or  Eat in Lowell ?
  body: Because I've been in this area for 40 yrs.,  I've been in Lowell many times;  sometimes weekly.    So, I know about most parts of the city,  and I don't mind driving in Downtown Lowell at all.   (Except for the traffic problems)     We can't afford to go to restaurants this year,  but I know there are many good ones in Lowell.    And, there have been "Diners" in Lowell for a great many years.   The "Owl Diner" is very popular.     But, we had to go to the Register a month or so ago,  and we accidentally found a new "diner" type shop around the corner.     I can't remember the name of it,  but we went in to get some lunch.    They serve very unique sandwiches,  and all the sandwiches have a name which has something to do with the Courthouse and lawyers, etc.     We can recommend it,  and will try to get to it again some day.   ..   Do other people have restaurants in Lowell that they like to go to?

I was told that, if we don't receive these calls,  one possible reason is that we have an unlisted #.     Perhaps there are other reasons.    But, I was told that I need to call Town Hall and get our phone #  on their list of homes to call."

  subject: Does Your neighborhood lose Electricity more than others?
  body: Hello.     Just curious if there are some parts of the town  (some neighborhoods)  which lose electricity during bad storms -  more than other parts of the town.      And,  are there some neighborhoods  which .should.  be nearer the top of the list for getting electricity back?     Meaning, are there some neighborhoods which are more .needy.  than others?       (Also,  there are many residents who still have a "house phone"  and, when the electricity goes out, so does their phone.     So, the only way they can make a call is to use their "cell phone" -  IF they are lucky enough to have one !   )      (For low-income families,  do you know there are ways to get a .free.  cell-phone?)        --   Just a reminder that January and SNOW will be arriving on our doorsteps - soon !

I keep forgetting to call in our reservation for the following week !     :o(      Just curious if there are other "seniors" who are members of the Senior Center,  and have met various people at the lunches.     ..  We also attended the concert of "the Singing Trooper" and really enjoyed it.    I also wish I could remember to check out the "calendar" for the Senior Center to see if there are other events we should attend.      We try to sit at different tables, so we meet more people.  ..    My 2 aunts from Chelmsford were active members of the Center during the 1970's to 1980's, and then Mrs. Kidder during the 1990's.    She ate lunch there every weekday and at that time everyone had -- their favorite table to sit at.   //   This summer, if you saw a man who decided he wanted to play Santa this Christmas, that was us.     :o)

I just heard on this web site that there is someone else interested in attending such a group.     IF  there are more people who are interested,  I'll contact both libraries, and the senior centers,  to find out if they have a conference room available.    Perhaps to start out - once a month on a Tuesday or Wednesday - perhaps at 10 am.     I wouldn't have time to get such a group started during December,  but maybe I'll reserve a room in mid-January -- depending on the weather.      Another suggestion is to alternate towns.    And, I'm curious whether there are more .seniors.  doing genealogy than .younger adults.     ...   Just a reminder that there is already a Chelmsford Genealogy Club which meets at night,  and a Greater Lowell Genealogy Club which meets on Saturday afternoons.    I have never heard of one in Billerica.       (FYI:    I do my genealogy from 4:30-5 am to 8 am, 7 days a week.)    (And I'm very active at  www.rootsweb.com)"

  body: Just curious how many can name all the working farms in town.    Or, at least know about them.      And, several of them are offering Christmas trees this month.      It's too bad one of the long-standing "apple farms" is not open this fall.    The owners tried to retire 2 yrs. ago but their family encouraged them to stay open.    Oops.   I just remembered they are only open on weekends;   I'll have to drive over that way on Sat.     The other "apple farm" not far from there should still be open,  but maybe not after Dec. 1.     (great applie pies at both shops)

    I'd be glad to share the name of the first plumber, if anyone wants to know.

  subject: Hooping
  body: |-
    I know there must be some in this area that hoop as well! For those that aren't sure what I mean; hooping refers to the dance and artistic movement with a hula hoop. There are so many benefits with hooping such as health and fitness, stress-relief, rhythmic massage of your organs and intestines, and has energetic benefits as well.
    
    I am hoping to gather up some people to simply hoop, swap tips, and be social! This might even be a fun group for those that are interested. I know I'm a beginner so I am craving more experienced hooping peers to share their moves! =D
    
    Even if you're interested in starting-- I have some resources where you can make your own hoop if you don't want to purchase your own. =] Hoops should be customized to your height (and skill level). 
    Hope to hear from you guys!

  subject: Getting Children Involved
  body: |
    I moved to Chelmsford six years ago and still cannot believe how difficult it is to find philanthropic opportunities for 12-16 year old citizens.  I've tried to teach my daughters both sales, people and giving skills since they were five, but other than what I do on my own I find our town lacking for this age group.  I even tried to get the town to sponsor a junior philanthropy club that I was willing to oversee, but was turned down.  Any ideas on this...do you know of a program I'm missing, etc.  
    
    Welcome feedback!

So far all the productions have been great, but this is the best so far. The intimate staging of the Black Box just adds to the whole production. There are nine performances left. Check the Community Events on the site or the BPAC website for dates and time.

  body: Hello.   Again,  I don't see a category for some of the subjects I'd like to discuss.     I'm curious how many have learned about the history of Chelmsford.     It was incorporated in 1655, but people were starting to live here before that.     And, how many of you have a "history of Chelmsford"  in your home?    There are 2 books,  the larger, more detailed one is by WATERS,  I believe.     I have always wanted to have my own copy,  but they are too expensive for me.       So, I used to borrow them from the library in past years.

    The Homegrown String Band is a \xE2\x80\x9C100% natural organically grown\xE2\x80\x9D band.  The \xE2\x80\x9Cfamily that plays together\xE2\x80\x9D is the traditional American family band.  The Jackofsky family performs original and traditional roots music, which is interspersed with interesting historical notes and anecdotes about the songs and the instruments used to present them.\n\n\
    America's premier purveyor of family-style original and neo-traditional acoustic American roots music, this quartet from Rocky Point, New York, utilizes unique instrumentation, percussive flatfoot dancing, and many varied musical influences to take their audiences on a rollicking ride through the sounds of American music.\n\n\
    Their repertoire consists of traditional and original music inspired by the rural string bands that recorded during the 1920s and \xE2\x80\x9830s, as well all the great American roots music that followed.\n\n\
    Rick Jackofsky, the patriarch of the family, sings and plays guitar, banjo, and harmonica, while mother, Georgianne, dances and plays mountain dulcimer, banjo-ukulele, and doumbek.  Daughters, Erica and Annalee, also both dance, each having their own unique style.  Erica also sings and plays the fiddle, while Annalee sings, plays the mandolin, and wows the audience with her twanging jaw harp.\n\n\
    The tradition of American roots music is a tradition of change and the Homegrown String Band is carrying on that American tradition by using the tools at hand and borrowing from various musical genres to create something new and unique.  Their original music has been lauded as \xE2\x80\x9Cheartfelt, original, insightful, and impressive.\"\n\n\

  subject: "Christmas/Holidays: Schools, Towns, and Politics (State vs Religion)"
  body: |-
    Is it me because of my age, heritage, and up bringing or is it really the Far Left or Right in Politics and Religion?
    
     Look at our Nations Hypocrisies, State Capitals and Local Cities and Towns draped with, Christmas Symbolism, Decorated Trees, lights, wreaths, bulbs, ribbons, bobbles and more...Yet we take away a child's cookies if they symbolize anything to do with Christmas and tell them you can not bring those into school. Who are we really hurting and making to feel guilty? The answer is the Children. I myself celebrate with friends of other religions in there homes Christmas, yet they are Jewish, some are muslim and other from the Orients and Asia and I can tell you they Celebrate not only Christmas, but also Hanukkah, and their religious joys. I have not changed my ways as they are somewhat set over time and wish all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year openly about my daily travels and have not yet received a negative response in return. To say happy holidays to me is like going with the flow of the extreme right or left, not meaning or wish truly any certain positive human greeting. Those that have said they are not Christian or do not believe in Christmas, I wish them well and good tidings. Humans can never be "Politically Correct" or without offense somewhere down the road of life. So why do we make great issues of it at all.

    The planned owners have changed their mind; now I'm scrambling to find a home for a male American Pit Bull and a mixed GS/Lab Female, 2 year old mix to good home with a yard and loves to play and go for runs. She hasn't learned to be social with strange dogs; needs to learn new dog etiquette, prospective owner must have experience with dogs. (she plays well with neighbor dogs but not with strange dogs or strangers - she decides on her own who she is friendly to - so it's better to be safe and cautious)

  subject: Train horns in Burnsville.
  body: "Hi everyone,\n\n\
    I thought that this would be a great forum to help answer a local environmental question that I have had since moving to Burnsville 6 years ago.  Here is the question:\n\n\
    Are you sometimes woken up by the sound of train horns in the middle of the night?  (And subsequently wish the noise would stop.)\n\n\
    For me the answer is yes and I suppose there are a couple of reasons.  First, I am a light sleeper.  Second, our home is about a mile from the rail road intersection near Cliff road and 35W, and due to wind direction, 100+ decibel train horns can be heard \xE2\x80\x9Cplain as day\xE2\x80\x9D.  I also remember reading about people being upset by train horn noise in the River Hills area of Burnsville and I\xE2\x80\x99m wondering if this is still an issue.  I\xE2\x80\x99m also wondering if people in the Heart of the City area can hear the train noise since this location is close to the same intersection.\n\n\
    I\xE2\x80\x99m looking forward to your comments.  (Yes or no to the question, and if yes, let us know in what part of the city you live in.)\n\n\
    And a quick follow-up question:\n\n\
    If you answered yes to the first question, are you aware that there is a technology that can be implemented by the city to help solve this noise problem?\n\n\
    If you are curious, take a look at www.quietzonetech.com.\n\n\
    Thanks.\n"

  subject: Best source of News For Burnsville
  body: Just curious, what/where residents of Burnsville gather news regarding Burnsville. When I mention news I mean crime, obituaries, schools (general info and activities related to),business openings, business closings etc. With all due respect to our local news sources (This Week, Sun Current, Burnsville Patch)it seems as though they have become "folksy" community sources and not actual news sources.The tv stations give very little coverage to "South of the River"suburbs and when they do it is several days old. It is a shame we do not have better coverage of a city this size.

  subject: "PET LOVERS! Click the link below before Thursday @ 2:00 pm to support SB 359! "
  body: This bill allows for the spaying and neutering of community cats who are part of a formal trap/neuter/release (TNR) program. As you know, TNR is an effective, humane way to control community cat populations. These programs also significantly reduce the number of cats entering municipal animal shelters, saving lives as well as taxpayer dollars. And by spaying, neutering and vaccinating community cats, TNR helps promote public health, too.  http://www.capwiz.com/bestfriends/issues/alert/?alertid=60249606&type=CU&utm_source=delivra&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=vasb359&mid=784824637&ml=22568067

  body: |+
    Hello.   I just tried to post about this in another post  (not a Group), and it didn't show up.     One of my ancestors, Thomas KIDDER, lived in Chelmsford in 1720's.   In 1729 when Westford was annexing off,  his large, nice house and property became part of Westford.    It was on what is now Texas Road.    I believe his large property became what is now .conservation land.     I just went to look up the name of it,  and discovered there is a .hike.  going to happen soon - through that land.   It is called the "Emmet Conservation Land"  off of Carlisle Road:
    
    http://www.westfordconservationtrust.org/wct/News/Newsletters/2009Q1.pdf
    
    (FYI:   Thomas "dropped dead" the day of the annexation.   So, his widow and 5 young sons were left to live in the nice home.    His widow remarried a few yrs. later, and had 2 more children.   The nice "Samuel FITCH house"  would later become a "B&B" in Westford.     I was never able to find out which nice house the widow and her 2nd husband lived in after they married in 1730's.)

    I recently ordered some white rolls from Lance's Bakery, and they were delightful! I haven't tasted anything as good since I was a little kid, tagging along with my mother to the local bakery. The flavor of these rolls registered even while paired with ham and swiss cheese! I have ordered more and look forward to trying the other breads at Lance's Bakery. 
    
    FYI: it's located near the post office, on 309 Washington St., 720-2254.

  subject: Owosso Downtown Farmers' Market
  body: |
    As a former businessman who patented and produced products for national distribution; helped to develope multi-hundred million dollar projects; and, up until recently, taught college courses on how to start and grow businesses - I can categorically state that there are lessons to be learned from the decline of the downtown market.
    
    Every summer I have groups of visitors from out-of-state from as far away as Boston and Jacksonville (Florida). On the top of the list of things they want to do is a visit to the Farmers' Market because in many parts of the country such markets are rare or nonexistent. In addition, my wife and I purchase hundreds of dollars of produce for the table and canning, and handmade craft items, honey, syrup, baked and hot foods. The market has been located in a beautiful setting next to the river walk and on a well maintained parking lot across the street from the new landscaped parking lot - both of which have already been paid for by the taxpayers. 
    
    Last summer changes were made that resulted in many of the vendors opening up a second market in the Kroger parking lot. Since then, every Saturday the downton market was half empty and some vendors were allocated to booth spaces on West Exchange street.
    
    The market has been operating successfully since 1974. The changes that have been made have again proven the old adage, "If it ain't broke don't fix it!"
    
    I read in the February 5th Independent that booth spaces along West Exchange street will replace use of the parking lot. That seasonal booth space fees will increase from $65 to $100 and vendor single day fees from $15 to $20. In addition, two co-market masters will be paid $5,100 each!
    
    What possible reason can there be for moving the market from a parking lot that is empty on the weekends and instead locate them in the street which will take up the parking spaces in front of businesses that are open on the weekend?
    
    The impact of increasing the seasonal and daily fees will only drive more vendors to relocate to the Kroger Store parking lot. The increase in fees may not seem like a lot to those who serve on the Downtown Development Authority Board, but it is to the vendors. 
    
    I use as an example two elderly ladies that sell a variety of homemade breads, cookies and other pastries. Each week I buy one or two loaves of bread for $5 each and a couple of cookies for 50 cents each. If you deduct the cost of their ingredients, utilities and booth fees,  their profit from the sale of their baked goods - from which they earn their income - is about $3.00 per hour, or less than half the Federal minimum wage! This figure doesn't even include the cost of equipment and facilities which would be included in the normal cost of a bakery business.  The booth fee comes right off the top of their small profits. 
    
    It takes at least that much and even more work for all those vendors that bring their fruits, vegetables and craft items to market. The vendors are faced with four choices: 1) make less profits, 2) pass that cost onto their customers - including those who are using WIC vouchers to buy healthy foods for their families, 3) move to a different market, 4) stop taking their products to market - when profit incentives are reduced to a certain level vendors simply stop producing.
    
    As for the Co-Market Masters, how much labor is there to assigning vendors to 40 to 50 booth spaces and some seasonal advertising? Why not let the 4-H and the FFA clubs manage the market? It will give the youth an opprtunity to learn more about entrepeneurship and raise funds for their organizations.
    
    At a time when we need to be encouraging healthy eating and the development of small businesses, fees should not be raised - they should be reduced to no more than $40 per season or $5 per day. Then the market vendors will increase their profits by a modest amount and the number of vendors and shoppers will increase.
    
    If the DDA wants to improve entrepreneurship opportunites and downtown business development it is recommended that their goal be to acquire the now-vacant Armory and create a year round farmers market like they have in Flint - http://flintfarmersmarket.com/ - which has been ranked number one in the country. This is just one of the recommendations of the citizens'  "Blue Ribbon Committee Report to the city of Owosso, 2008." (Online copy is available).

  subject: "\"Trash Barrel\"  discussions"
  body: Hello.   Maybe 2 yrs. ago there were discussions at Town Hall as to whether the Town should start using the "special"  trash barrels which people in nearby towns are using.    The ones where a special "trash truck" picks up the barrel and empties it into the truck.     The last part of the discussion I remember was that Town Hall couldn't decide whether to go with the smaller size or the larger size.     I had forgotten about this until this week when we drove through Billerica.    It was trash day in the part of town we were in, and we saw a truck picking up the "special barrel."      I'm curious why Town Hall decided .not.  to go with these "special barrels."

  body: Has everyone neutered their male dogs?  And are you seeing a weight gain? I have two cockers and I neutered one as a puppy and left the other one (at the request of the breeder) for potential stud use. Now, he's 6 years old and fit as a fiddler and the other one (4 years old) is a tubby little guy--waddling over to his dog dish and eating like a small hog. Do you change food once they are neutered? I would like to neuter the older one, but he's such a beauty now . . .

  body: "I have had several community members approach me asking about Time Banking in the Falls Church community.  Is there anyone else interested out there?  What are your thoughts?  Could we hold a meeting to discuss the idea and perhaps establish our very own FC Time Bank?  The following is an extract from an article explaining Time Banks.\n\
    Sincerely,\n\
    Matt and the TransitionFC team\n\n\
    \"[Timebanks] are a clever tool to circumvent the scarcity and misdirection of conventional money. Timebanks are at heart a simple concept \xE2\x80\x93 you work for an hour, earn an hour credit, and spend an hour with anyone in your Timebank community. Timebanks don't pay taxes or get penalized in benefit reductions because they are more like charitable volunteering circles of mutual aid or relationship-based gift economies than market-based national currencies.\n\n\
    Timebank values are:\n\n\
    We are all assets - we all have something to give.\n \n\
    Some work is beyond price - work has to be redefined to value whatever it takes to create healthy, socially just, and sustainable communities and that work needs to be honored, recorded and rewarded.\n \n\
    Reciprocity - helping works better as a two-way street and we need to work together to build better communities.\n \n\
    We need each other- people help each other to reweave communities of support, strength & trust by creating relationships through exchanges.\n \n\
    Respect - every human being matters and no one should go without getting their needs met regardless of their position in life. (Stemming from this, everyone\xE2\x80\x99s hour is equal in a Timebank.)\"\n\

    Hey neighbors,
    Spring is on its way and my mom and I are have been busy tearing up our lawn to start a couple of gardens. We have plenty of more space and we were wondering if there were any neighbors out there without access to land who may want to use a small plot of ours to start a garden. You will of course be entitled to whatever you grow! If you would like to please message me, you simply have to agree to be dedicated to taking care of the garden throughout the spring and summer.
    Also is there anyone else interested in forming a garden share on their land to provide neighbors without land with a place to grow some veggies?  Please discuss!

  body: |-
    From what I have heard, the school board is currently planning to bypass LEED certification of TJ's new add-on which is under construction.  LEED certification is a holistic evaluation of how environmentally (and I would argue economically) sustainable a building is.  We encourage all private contractors to build with LEED silver certification in the city.  Is there anyone who can offer their thoughts about this issue or some more information about what's going on right now?  Is there anyone who feels strongly about this issue and may want to get a group together to meet and discuss it?

    Looking for a small group of people to bike with on local trails early Saturday or Sunday mornings beginning in Spring when temperature rises.  7:00 a.m. (flexible) for about 10-15 miles at a moderate pace (getting exercise but not racing speed -- maybe 10-12 mph with short, interval sprints--something like that).  Would not want to drive bike to location so trails used would be right in this area.
    
    Will check this site for posts.  Thanks!

  body: Would like to form a small biking group to bike local trails on Sat. or Sun. mornings around 7 a.m. (flexible) , 10-15 miles, moderate pace.  Exercise but not racing, short sprint intervals possibly.  Bike close by -- don't want to drive bike to site.  Would begin when temperature rises -- 50 degrees?  Will check this site for posts.  Thanks!

  subject: Consignment Shops, Thrift Shops, Second-Hand Shops
  body: |
    Hello.    I'm pretty sure I've mentioned before that there are many second-hand shops available for residents of Chelmsford which are less than a half-hour drive from here.    Wilmington, Billerica, Burlington,  Tewksbury, Lowell, Dracut, Nashua, Westford, Littleton, etc.    I thought I had found or visited most of them,  but I found a new one in Littleton yesterday.   It had some interesting items for sale;  there's a children's consignment shop across from it.    I don't have time right now,  but, when I have time, I can list all the ones we visit, or know about.    Or, perhaps others can mention the ones they like to visit.     Most do not accept clothing,  but some do.   Some are small and can only accept a few items of furniture;  some have a large room just for furniture.    You can .donate.  or you can .consign.  sellable items.      (An FYI:    We started watching "NATE" on Ch. 5 at 10 am,  and he is always talking about things he finds at 2nd-hand shops - which he .loves.  to re-do !    At this moment they are talking about buying "dish towels"  (old kinds) and using them to make pillows.   Some have shown to take your old sweater and use it to make a pillow.      This lady is also talking about a wooden chair she bought at a Flea Market and it needed new upholstery.)    (Now that I've mentioned Flea Markets,  they should be opening for the season in early April.    And, Yard Sales should be starting around the same time.    For all low-income people, you don't have to go to brand-name stores to find some nice items that you need !)
    
    At ShanksMare last week, they had an unusual, small, antique kitchen stove for sale  (outside use only),  and I know someone who is trying to give away an antique, Parlor stove  (non-usable, only for decoration).

  body: "\n\
    GREENWOOD LAKE PUBLIC LIBRARY\n\
    NEW:  March 2012 Artist-of-the-Month\n\
    Helen Nicole Hill\n\
    Exhibit:  \xE2\x80\x9CHiking In and Around Ringwood\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    through Wed., Mar. 28, 2012\n\n\n\
    Artist, Helen Nicole Hill, will be exhibiting her works at the Greenwood Lake Public Library Works of Art Gallery through the month of March 2012.  The Library is located at 79 Waterstone Road in Greenwood Lake, New York.\n\n\
    Hill is a resident of Ringwood, New Jersey.  Her exhibit, \xE2\x80\x9CHiking In and Around Ringwood,\xE2\x80\x9D is a series of watercolors, which include images of local landscapes of the greater West Milford area.\n\n\
    Having spent her formative years in Belgium and England, Hill's love of art began at a young age while visiting European museums with her family.  She then moved onto St. Michael's College, Vermont, where she received a B.A. in 1996.  At St. Michael's, she flourished as a young artist, steeped in influences from abstract expressionists, such as Jackson Pollack and Willem de Kooning.  After a decade of using oil pastels and creating oil paintings, Hill transitioned to watercolor painting.\n\n\
    Hill has a love of the outdoors and most of her paintings come from miniature sketches that she does while hiking or biking in and around Ringwood, New Jersey.  She takes inspiration from the Pointillist method, as well as \xE2\x80\x9Cpainting the light\xE2\x80\x9D as Impressionists did.  She is also greatly influenced by the watercolor painter Shirley Felt's use of saturated color and sketchy, thick layers of paint.\n\n\
    Meet the artist at the Greenwood Lake Public Library during the Art Extravaganza 2012, which will be held on Sunday, April 29th, 2012, from 12:30-2:30 p.m., where additional works by Hill will be on display.\n\n\
    For information about the exhibit or the Works of Art Gallery, contact Kelly Corrado, Gallery Coordinator, by phone at (845) 477-8377 Ext. 108 or by E-mail at kcorrado@rcls.org.\n\n"

  body: "I've been a pro bass player and teacher for decades, and teach at SUNY and Ramapo College (as well as elsewhere). In private lessons, I teach all levels but particularly love to work with beginners and intermediate players, teens and older - especially adults. \n\
    My students learn how music works: not just where to put your fingers, but why we choose the notes we choose. We cover chord progressions, notation, chart reading, and much more.\n\
    If you're interested, reply and include a phone number. I'll be in touch to discuss details.\n\
    Thanks,\n\

    Long ago in Ireland, Celtic storytellers were very important people in the community; they had the task of preserving history in their stories.  Like the Native Americans, the Celts had an oral culture and an elaborate mythology.  Storytellers trained for years to become masters of their craft and they committed their knowledge and skill to memory.  These stories were recited aloud and provided great entertainment for the people.\n\n\
    Join Bairbre McCarthy, a professional Irish storyteller, as she continues this tradition at this program featuring stories of ancient kings, heroes, fairy folk, and mythological legends blended with the early history of Ireland.\n\n\
    Accompanied by multi-instrumentalist, Frank Orsini, whose musical performance using the fiddle, guitar, and harp, enhances Bairbre\xE2\x80\x99s storytelling and adds tandem-storytelling, singing, and dancing to this program that celebrates the Irish.\n\n\
    Bairbre is a seancha\xC3\xAD (storyteller) and author from County Clare.  She is noted for her knowledge of Irish mythology, folklore, and language and enjoys collaborations with other artists.  She is the founder and director of the children\xE2\x80\x99s program at Catskills Irish Arts Week, the largest summer school in North America devoted to the Irish Traditional Arts.  She is also a New York State certified teacher of English, French, and Gifted students.\n\n\
    Bairbre\xE2\x80\x99s books and CDs include:  Favourite Irish Legends (dual \xE2\x80\x93 language book and CD), Irish Leprechaun Stories, The Adventures of C\xC3\xBAchulainn, The Keeper of the Crock of Gold, and Introduction to the Irish Language:  Easy Irish Lessons for Beginners (CD).  For additional information about Bairbre, visit www.bairbremccarthy.com.\n\n\
    Frank Orsini is a prominent acoustic musician in upstate New York.  He plays violin, viola, mandolin, and Celtic harp and is a versatile fiddler, singer, and seasoned ensemble player, who is featured on numerous recordings and has been a member of several groups.\n\n\
    Frank\xE2\x80\x99s repertoire and expertise is extensive and spans Elizabethan and Early music, Celtic, Bluegrass, Country, and Blues, as well as dance tunes from olde England, New England, Canada, Appalachia, American swing, and Cajun. \n\n\

  subject: Help to protect a significant woodland threatened by development.
  body: A proposed Planned Unit Development (PUD) at 4900 Triton Drive threatens to destroy a 1.2 acre significant woodland, as defined by the city Tree Preservation Ordinance.  The Planning Commission and the Council have both approved preliminary PUD plans.  Extensive inputs from neighbors have not effected any meaningful change that might reduce the impact.  Our city claims to value such natural resources.  Please help us convince our city employees and representatives to take action to walk that talk.  Thank-you.

  subject: Dog Dumping in Clarkston
  body: "it is sad to know that others too are having to rescue dumped dogs.   I cannot bear to think they would end up at the \"DeKalb H**l Hole\".   My husband, Jack, and myself are now the owners of 3 dogs which were dumped here.   The last one tied to a tree in our backyard.   We managed to snag her before the paddy wagon called by the police came to drag her away.   \n\n\
    And while speaking on this subject  - I would like to suggest that folks really LOOK at the dogs being dumped who \"appear\" to be pit-bulls as many of them ARE NOT this breed.   While we do own one pure APBT - the latest one is not.   She is actually an Argentinian Mastiff  - totally different personality and form.   Unfortunately - these dogs are often put down first and very quickly at DeKalb.   Our APBT was a dumped puppy when we got her - as she landed on our back-door step 3 years ago.   The reason I am saying this - is that it could be the differene between life or death for many of these truly loving animals.   Both of our Pit like rescues were completely house broken when dumped - and completely trained - so they were someone's pets.  They were completely horrified and scared to death.   Which in some instances can look like aggression - but is most often their own shyness.       \n\n\
    I do work with several groups which do nothing but rescue and foster pits - and pit type dogs.   I would be glad to share this information for those interested.    "

  subject: Comcast
  body: |-
    Has anyone in Golden Valley had problems with Comcast? Within a two week time frame, our Comcast had gone out four times. We are bundled with them, so that means our phone, computer and cable. Our phone line has frequent static and often there is an echo when you talk. Very frustrating. If you have these problems too, please let me know where you live as I am in the process of documenting these problems outside my neighborhood to share with them.
    thanks-DeDe

  subject: Chickens in Golden Valley
  body: |+
    In 2010, a small number of residents approached the Golden Valley City Council and requested that the Council possibly amend the City Code to allow residents to keep chickens. At that time, the vote on the council was to not allow chickens in Golden Valley.
    
    Now, at an upcoming Council Manager Meeting the topic of chickens in Golden Valley will be reviewed again. Tuesday, April 10, the Golden Valley Council will be discussing the pros and cons of raising chickens in the city.
    
    Regardless of whether you are in favor of allowing chickens or whether you would prefer not to see them in Golden Valley, please contact Council Members and have your voice heard. 
    
    If you go to the city website at www.goldenvalleymn.gov you can find the contact information for the Mayor and Council to express your opinion regarding chickens. We look forward to hearing from you.

    NEW:  \xE2\x80\x9CBudding Artist Gallery:\n\
    April Student-Artist-of-the-Month:  Brooke Heffner\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    Through Sun., 04/29/12\n\n\
    Brooke Heffner (6) is the April Student-Artist-of-the-Month!  Her exhibit, \xE2\x80\x9CIn Living Color by Brooke,\xE2\x80\x9D is currently featured at the Greenwood Lake Public Library's Budding Artist Gallery, a student art gallery, through April 29th, 2012.\n\n\
    Brooke has loved drawing ever since she was a toddler.  She enjoys drawing pictures and coloring and painting. \n\n\
    When she\xE2\x80\x99s not drawing, Brooke loves to read books, visit the Greenwood Lake Public Library with her grandparents, play educational games on the computer, and play outdoors.\n\n\
    Brooke is a member of the Daisies Troop #260 in Greenwood Lake, New York, and she also attends ballet and tap dance school during her spare time.  She most certainly gets her artistic talent from her father, John Heffner, who also has a passion for drawing.\n\n\
    Brooke is the daughter of Tanya and John Heffner.\n\n\
    If you are a student artist under the age of 18 and would like to exhibit at the Budding Artist Gallery, please contact Kelly Corrado, Gallery Coordinator, by telephone at (845) 477-8377 Ext. 108 or by E-Mail at kcorrado@rcls.org.\n\n"

There are oodles of floating beverage bottles in the pond behind city hall, fire muster kids helmets in the wooded area, etc.  Perhaps we could get a Sat.morning effort together city for a big cleanup.  Any ideas anyone?

  subject: Volunteer for Alex Buck for State Senate
  body: |-
    Hi,
    I'm Alex Buck and I'm running for State Senate to replace Susan Fargo who is retiring. I live here in Chelmsford, and we are putting together an great campaign and need your help! If you can help, please contact Kim Schroff (contact info below). We also have interships available (see below).
    Best,
    Alex
    
    The Alex Buck Campaign
    Alex Buck is running for State Senate in the 3rd Middlesex District because he believes we need elected leaders who understand our communities and will put our families first.  He is stepping up to take on powerful interests and fight for the resources our communities need to strengthen our schools, improve our roads and foster economic growth.  
    
    Internships 
    The Alex Buck campaign is looking for highly motivated interns who are excited to be a part of a grassroots effort.  Interns will learn about the structure of local politics and how a successful campaign operates.  Interns will have the opportunity to participate in several campaign activities including but not limited to: 
    
    Door-to-door canvasses
    Phone banks
    Research & analysis
    Coordinate & attend local events  
    
    Internships are available for a variety of schedules.  Interns looking to volunteer on a full or part time basis are welcome.  There are two full time positions available for a stipend; these individuals will be given more responsibility and take on a leadership role.  A commitment to progressive politics is the only requirement.  Electoral or issue campaign experience is a plus, but not required. 
    
    Please submit a cover letter and resume to schroff.k@gmail.com

    Isabel Tappan-deFrees will come to your home and give your dog or cat a top-notch grooming job.  My dog loves Izzy and enjoyed having her bath.  Izzy easily set up her equipment in my place, where I've got electrical outlets in out-of-the-way places and hardly any space, so I can imagine that she can adapt to any home situation.  She works very quickly, and has ways of putting animals at ease. She also knows how to do Reiki with animals.  Pretty cool.  Here's her site:

  subject: School Board Sad Times
  body: I see in the paper that the School Board decided to cut Fernbank's budget by 2/3 and still have to cut further. Montessori has been cut/IB has been cut/everyone needs to watch this closely. It affects everyone if the DeKalb School System stops programs that affect primarily the gifted, motivated students. Those families will begin pulling out.

    Hello!
    We have a 2 yr old as well as an 8 mth old, and we are looking for a babysitter to help us out a few hours (maybe not every week, but most weeks). We would be looking at one day during the morning (pretty open as far as what day).
    
    If you are interested and/or know someone that you can recommend, please send me a message. If it is about yourself, please include your experience, hourly rate and possible days/ times that you would be available.
    
    Thank you,
    Ines
    
    PS: We also have a black lab who is really friendly, so the person must be ok with dogs!

  subject: Dog sitter and walker
  body: |
    Hello,
    
    we are looking for someone who would be interested to pet sit our dog (3 yr old black lab. Her name is Leah) while we are on vacation (one week at the end of June as well as 2 weeks end of Aug/beginning of Sep). Ideally, Leah could stay with this person at their home (she sleeps in the crate). She is generally good with other dogs, but does get protective towards other dogs when our babies are around. So if you have a dog yourself, we would of course want to test it out first to make sure they like each other. She LOVES to play and has a lot of energy. 
    
    In addition, we would be looking for that person to also walk her during the day a couple of times a week. She does get her walks daily, but with 2 little ones, she is not getting out as much as we would like her to.
    
    If you are interested, please message me to let me know what your experience is (dog sitting and dog walking), if you have (or had) dogs yourself, what days/ times you would be available for dog walking and if you would be open to dog sit Leah while we are on vacation. Please include your hourly rate as well as how much you would charge for dog sitting (including at least 1 walk during the day).
    
    Thanks,
    Ines

  subject: Do you need morning childcare?
  body: |
    Hi, My children are starting kindergarden and pre-school in September and I will no longer need my nanny in the morning.  As a result she is looking to pick up a few hours anytime between 6:30 am and 11:30 am.  She has been our nanny for the last 2 years and we couldn't be happier.  She is always on time and almost never calls in sick.  She loves my girls like her own.  She is caring, patient, and intelligent.  Prior to being our nanny she worked in an in home daycare for 4 years and has lots of experience with infants.  She is great with older kids as well.  She was a former teacher in Sri Lanka and continues to teach piano lessons in the late afternoons.  She drives and lives in North Arlington.  If you need someone to get your kids off to school in the morning, or if you need a mothers helper, etc.. I highly recommend her.  Her name is Pryanthi and she can be reached at 240-543-5346

  subject: Full-Time Nanny Available in September
  body: "Hello, Because our 5-year old will be attending kindergarten this fall, we are helping our nanny find a full-time position in the area.  Ximena is an active caregiver and is wonderful with children of all ages.  Ximena is experienced, reliable, legal, fluent in both English and Spanish, a good driver, and our daughter loves her!  \n\n\
    As our nanny, Ximena plays with, and plans playdates for our daughter.   Ximena is great with both indoor and outdoor activities.  She will sit on the floor for board games and building with blocks, and is super creative with arts and crafts.  She also makes sure to get outside, and takes our daughter to the park, to play in the yard and for bike rides (or just a stroll on a nice day when our daughter was younger).  Because Ximena has worked in Arlington and Falls Church, she knows lots of kid-friendly places.  Ximena also drives our daughter to and from preschool, and is a very safe driver.  Ximena performs light food shopping, laundry and cooking duties, and makes sure that our daughter is safe and happy.  I trust her completely.  And, in the three years that she has been with us, I can\xE2\x80\x99t remember a time when Ximena called in sick.  \n\n\
    Ximena is looking for full time, Monday-Friday position, or can be flexible with 4 days a week, and is looking to start in September.  She has been a nanny for families with 1-3 children, and has participated in a nanny share. She has many wonderful references.  \n\n\
    We want to help Ximena find the right family.  We are sad to lose her, but just can\xE2\x80\x99t justify a full-time nanny.  Please call me if you have any questions or want more information, or contact Ximena directly.  Ximena\xE2\x80\x99s number is 703-499-4531.  \n\n\
    Thanks!\n\

  subject: Unaware Racism on KUAF
  body: "Hello dear neighbors,\n  Just the other day I was driving and turned on the radio.  I almost always keep it set to KUAF, ans so I happened onto the tail end of a public service announcement for the Shiloh Museum's exhibit about the lives of people in our area during the Civil War.  The part I heard was that we would see the lives of \"men, women, children, and slaves.\"  I was shocked.  This implied that enslaved people were not \"men, women, and children.\"  This was the second time in a number of months that I had just flipped on the radio and stumbled upon an announcement with racist content.  \n\n\
    So-o-o, I wrote a letter to Rick Stockdell, the station manager.  Here is my letter:\n\n\
    Dear Rick Stockdell\n\
    (Station Manager at KUAF)\n\
    ,\n\
    Some months ago I wrote to you via the US mail about an advertisement for Ozarks At Large in which a racist reference was made about the residents in our community who live on Willow street.  You emailed me back that you had listened to that particular advertisement, and that indeed, it was inappropriate.  You apologized for it, and that was appreciated.\n\n\
    Unfortunately, I find myself writing to you again with a similar complaint.  This past Wednesday I was in my car, switched on the radio to your station and someone was advertising a program at the Shiloh Museum.  They spoke about being exposed to the lives of \" women, men, children and slaves.\"  Again, I was shocked.  To me this was like saying \"women, men, children and dogs\", as if the slaves in our country's history were not also men, women and children. \n\n\
    I believe these things being said on the air are not symptoms of meanness or hatred, but more of white privilege and arrogance.  It is based on an assumption that everyone who listens to your station is white or that the audience that matters is white.  Not only that, but it perpetuates attitudes that minorities in our city are not a relevant population and that they can be ignored and/or insulted without consequence. \n\n\
    I think that your apology to me some months earlier was genuine, but I don't see evidence that your feelings about this were shared with the staff at the station.  Even several months ago, I felt a little disappointed that this apology did not go out to the entire listening audience whose attitudes and consciousness are formed by this source of information that they trust.  But now, even more so, I can see a need for a public apology for these unaware blatantly racist statements being aired. \n\n\
    I want you to know that I am sending this letter to everyone I know who listens to KUAF.  These are the people who respond when you do your fundraisers each year.   It is my hope that you will keep that in mind when editing what is aired on your station.  I do believe your intentions are good in this area, but that with the huge amount of work involved in running the station, this concern can easily get buried at the bottom of the heap.  This is my attempt to move it to the top.  After all, if it isn't at the top, what is the station about really?\n\n\
    I did receive an response from the station manager, which I also believe is genuine and heartfelt.  Here it is:\n\n\
    Thank you for pointing out what was a very unfortunate choice of words in the Public Service Announcement we read from the Shiloh Museum in Springdale, promoting their exhibit on people who lived here during the Civil War era.   Perhaps it should have read \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\xA6women, men and children, including some who were slaves.\xE2\x80\x9D How would you have written it?\n\n \n\n\
    I agree the wording was inappropriate. But please know it was an innocent mistake and I don\xE2\x80\x99t believe it\xE2\x80\x99s reflective of the writer\xE2\x80\x99s belief\xE2\x80\x99s and certainly not of the station staff\xE2\x80\x99s. I\xE2\x80\x99m very sorry for offending you. The staff at KUAF is aware of both incidents you refer to in your email to me. We will all endeavor to be more sensitive and watchful in the future.\n\n \n\n\
    Thank you for listening and for alerting me to this error.  Constructive criticism from our listeners is important to all of us and we value the lessons our very informed and enlightened audience provide us.\n\n \n\n\
    Yours truly,\n\n \n\n\
    Rick Stockdell\n\n\
    I appreciated his response very much, but still have a sense that it doesn't address the unintended bias that comes through in a case like this.  It also was not an apology made to the listening audience who is affected by hearing these subtle announcements.  I wrote to Rick again:\n\n\
    Dear Rick,\n\n\
    I wanted to thank you for responding to my email to you, and for giving it your attention.  Do you think it is possible that you and I could continue a dialogue on this topic?  I would love to stay in contact with you about this and to hear your perspective.  Because we are from very different ethnicities, genders and probably even class we can see the world very differently. \n\n\
    I too agree that it was a unfortunate choice of words used in the Public Service announcement from Shiloh Museum.  I am aware that these words may have been the choice of the Museum itself and not that of KUAF.  I do worry though that your being the \"messenger\" puts the station in the position of condoning those words and disseminating them.  It may seem like a subtle effect these words have on the public, but remembering Ronald Reagan's \"trickle down\" theory, the end result is that they provide permission to see people of African Heritage as less than human, deny them jobs, housing, etc.  Because you are considered the voice of reason in our community that puts you in a difficult spot.  We in Fayetteville are seen as a primarily liberal thinking community, but I know we are a pocket of liberalism surrounded by a very conservative population in Northwest Arkansas and the station broadcasts over a very large range.   As a woman of African Heritage, I am very much aware that the national headquarters of the KKK is just down the road from us.\n\n\
    In our early history, in order to justify the enslavement of other human beings, we were encouraged to think of them as less than human.  They were considered the same as cattle, bought and sold.   that \"unfortunate choice of words\" reinforces that idea.  Those choices of language will continue in other forms as long as we are not aware of their roots in our culture.  None of us is to blame for the fact that racism permeates our lives and interactions with each other every day, but we are all responsible for putting an end to it.  I realize that you  may have a policy of simply reading on the air whatever Public Service Announcements you receive without examining them, but because of your reputation in the community that policy may need to be examined.  That brings us then to the values of the editor of such announcements.  We cannot edit out things that are so deeply rooted in our own consciousness that we cannot see them.  I have done diversity training for Walmart, Tyson's, and Alltel and would be delighted to provide an info-training for your staff. \n\n\
    I believe this incident could be an opportunity for learning for both the staff and the listening public.  That would involve, of course, a public acknowledgment of the \"unfortunate choice of words\" and an apology.  Anything less would be seen as acceptance and condoning such language.\n\
    I look forward to hearing from you on this.\n\
    Sincerely,\n\
    Dorothy Marcy\n\n\
    After several days of waiting, I have not hear anything from him, either through email or on the air.  So Now, I am hoping that this situation matters to you as well, and that you too, will be moved to take some sort of action to raise the awareness of KUAf and the Shiloh Museum about subtle (and sometimes not to subtle) racially tinged announcements.  We see the result of these things on the evening news and wonder what got into those people.  \n\n\n\n\
    Thank you,\n\
    Dorothy A. Marcy, M.Ed., LPC\n"

  body: "From 1996-2005 I was employed by the Town of Warwick, it was an honor and a privilege to serve the community that I grew up in. Unfortunately, I recieved a performance of duty injury in 2004, and was subsequently retired in 2005 after failed surgeries and being classified as permanently disabled.\xC2\xA0\n\
    For the taxpayers of Warwick- the Town has been paying lost wage benefits at $400/week since 2005, while getting nothing in return. The Town could have settled my Workers Comp case in 2005,06,07 at a huge cost savings both by eliminating the lost wage benefits, and reducing their WC premiums. I offered to settle the case in 2008, and it took 4years just to get a response of no from the Town Supervisor. The maximum settlement would have been no more than 7yrs of lost wage benefits. As of July of this year, the Town has surpassed what a settlement would have cost, yet they continue to flush $400 of your taxes down the toilet, week after week and year after year. Do the solar panels on Town Hall power calculators? How many more years are they going to kick this can down the road at your expense? Do the math- $400/week-$20,800 a year with no age cut off.

  subject: Parking in the Village
  body: I don't usually post anything here but I have a question that I hope someone can help me with. If you work in the village where are you supposed to park? I work from 9-5pm everyday and I found several parking spots on Oakland Ave that I would leave my car and not have to worry about the meters. I work in  a busy real estate office at the front desk and cannot go out every two hrs to feed the meter. Since about two weeks they have been working on Second St. and the 4/5 parking spots on Oakland now have meters. I had parked behind Burger King and was told that I couldn't park my car there. I was told by someone else that the parking lot where Cablevision used to be charges $200 a year. Call me crazy but that's a lot of money for me to pay to come to work just to park my car. It's not so bad now because the weather is nice but it's not going to be as pleasant in the winter to walk around looking for somewhere to park my car. This is more venting than anything else but if someone has a solution I would really appreciate it.

I've even been able to share a large culinary sage I split last fall with a neighbor, and gave some orange lilies to our neighbors and church as well. \n\n\
    Sept and Oct is a good time to prepare to split some of those bulked up hostas, bulbs and tubers. We are busy with a huge in-ground pool renovation back into a garden space. I would love to swap/share plants with others in the community if anyone is interested. \n\n\
    My inventory: Ever-baring raspberry shoots, sweet pea flower seeds (pastel shaves of pink, lavender and white), orange day lilies, munchkin hosta, and more.\n\n\
    I am looking for grape vines, various hostas, tubers/bulbs for more summer and fall color next year, etc. "

  body: "By Heather Yakin\n\n Published: 2:00 AM - 09/21/12 \n\n\
    GOSHEN \xE2\x80\x94 A 23-year-old Warwick man was sentenced Thursday in Orange County Court to 10 years in prison for an armed robbery.\n\
    Eric Mannings had pleaded guilty to first-degree robbery. On Jan. 10, Mannings, accompanied by a woman, used a loaded .45-caliber pistol to rob a man of $6 in Warwick. Mannings also received five years of post-release supervision by parole.\n\
    Mannings' accomplice, Kaitlyn Slicker, 22, of Warwick, had pleaded guilty to attempted second-degree robbery. She was sentenced Thursday by Judge Robert Freehill to time served \xE2\x80\x93 she spent about 6\xC2\xBD months in jail \xE2\x80\x93 and five years' probation.\n\n\
    Maybe if the town board wasn't wasting $400/week on lost wage benefits for a retiree, they could put more police officers on the street and shift to a proactive police dept, instead of only a reactive one. But I guess we all don't mind someone walking around town with a handgun robbing people of $6.00\n\
    In closing don't forget to vote Mike P. Sweeton for County Exec 2013, then he can waste tax dollars on a county level!"

    Supervisor Sweeton, 
    Thanks for this weeks lost wage benefit check. This brings the total amount of town money wasted to $149,600, without a reset button, or credit for benefits already paid.
    Are you open to sitting down and discussing a settlement yet, or will you still be cutting your nose off despite your face? Can't wait till your fundraiser on the 20th.
