It is a successor to Citizens for a Better Council, an informal organization of several hundred Falls Church City voters who joined together to support candidates for the Falls Church City Council at the June, 1959, election.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    CBC's objective is good City government, responsive to the needs and interests of Falls Church City residents.  \r\n\
    \r\n\
    CBC\xE2\x80\x99s three major functions are (1) to select able and qualified persons to run as CBC candidates for the Falls Church City Council and the Falls Church City School Board, and to seek their election; (2) to keep its members and the public informed about issues facing the Falls Church City government and school system, as well as CBC objectives, principles and activities; and (3) to promote civic engagement.\r\n\

  about: |-
    The City of Marquette established a Bikeability Committee in 2008 to discuss ways to provide a safer environment for the growing cyclist population. Members of the committee include city staff from planning, police, engineering, and manager's departments; bike commuters, KMK Bike Club members, Northern Michigan University personnel, and business representatives.
    
    After its establishment, the Bikeability Committee drafted a survey addressing three main concerns: cyclists' destinations; routes; and obstacles, while also having each cyclist identify- what they would consider- a bicycle friendly community. The survey results have enabled the Bikeability Committee to identify streets that were most heavily used by cyclists and, therefore, became priorities for safety solutions and educational opportunities.

  about: "As a growing city, Raleigh and her downtown are facing challenges. Transit, urban planning, and land use are new problems that we will face as the city grows. What will downtown\xE2\x80\x99s role be in all of this? I am trying to follow Raleigh\xE2\x80\x99s attempts at bringing back the urban center it once had in the early 1900\xE2\x80\xB2s.I am very interested in how downtown grows and how it will interact with the surrounding neighborhoods; some of them with very historic landmarks. Will Raleigh continue to support the suburban sprawl development that was so popular in the 70\xE2\x80\xB2s, 80\xE2\x80\xB2s, and 90\xE2\x80\xB2s that played a major factor in downtown\xE2\x80\x99s lack of interest?"

  about: |
    The most important, beloved figure in any Lebanese family is the grandmother, or sitti. This is especially true for the families, like ours, who started making the journey to America, from tiny Lebanese villages nearly a century ago. Our grandmothers were the caretakers and teachers of our home country's culture, faith and food. Always food.It cannot be overstated how vital those long, communal tables were to our understanding of family, life and who we are. Strangers and new arrivals from the homeland were always welcome. Meals were delicious and never-ending. Laughter and warmth floated amidst us and cascaded down across generations, holding us together, connecting us, as our families took root here in North Carolina.Sitti embodies this cherished sense of connectedness and family.From the Saleh and Hatem families to yours, welcome!

  about: |-
    In 1853 St. Paul was indeed a frontier town. Dirt streets, log cabins and steamboats were the order of the day. As early as 1852 the Minnesota Pioneer newspaper called for an organizational Farmers' Market. A Market House, a two-story brick building, was constructed at Seventh and Wabasha streets. It was St. Paul's first public market. While fresh produce was only available during the season, dairy products, flour, cakes and candies could be purchased year-round.
    
    The Market has had several homes during its long history, but always in the downtown St. Paul area. Its longest tenure was at Tenth and Jackson streets, opening in 1902. It remained there until freeway construction and downtown development claimed the site, causing a move to Fifth and Wall streets in 1982. A new design reminiscent of the original market--corrugated fiberglass--covers the 167 open-air stalls and bricks pave the walkways. The location today is near one of the areas selected in 1853 by St. Paul to house the first Farmers' Market.
    
    Today plans continue to develop a new and bigger market. The Market is operated by the St. Paul Growers' Association, Inc. The association allows only fresh, locally grown produce to be sold--directly from the grower to the consumer. Also available are bakery goods, cheese, poultry, buffalo, venison, beef, pork, lamb, maple syrup, eggs, bagel sandwiches, honey, organic plants and produce, flowers, plants, shrubs and many other items.
    
    For over 150 years The St. Paul Farmers' Market has been proud to enjoy the support of the community.  That tradition of support continues today.

  about: |
    In 2010, our first year working on Summer of Solutions, youth in Fayetteville, Arkansas focused on addressing issues in food production and consumption. Summer of Solutions 2010 was hosted by the OMNI Center for Peace, Justice, and Ecology, a local non-profit that offered access to space, resources, and connections, all of which were vital to our success. Our team members each concentrated on individual projects related to our overall vision, including healthy cooking classes for families, a rain-barrel business, garden beds created out of local bamboo, an advertising campaign for local farmers, and community garden development. As for summer 2011, we are excited to be working in the Walker Park neighborhood in South Fayetteville. We'll be conducting a listening project, assessing the needs of residents and mapping out the assets of the community. With community partners like the Applied Sustainability Center and the Walker Park Community Garden, we hope to host workshops in community centers throughout the summer.

  about: |-
    A skate plaza is a type of skate park design concept that focuses on creating
    an unique urban space for a community, that also supports skateboarding.
    
    Skate plazas are built like a real street environment, unlike a traditional skatepark.
    Some urban terrain elements that are incorporated into a skate plaza are benches,
    rails, and ledges. Unlike most modern day skate parks, which consist of stark vertical
    ramps and half pipes, the skate plaza resembles a public square in a town or city by
    incorporating landscaping and art to create an aesthetically pleasing, multi-use park
    for the community.
    
    The skate plaza consists of various stair sets and ledges. The stairs range from two
    to twelve sets. They also have hubbas (ledges) that go down some of the stairs.
    The ground in the skate plaza is extremely smooth for riding.
    
    Marquette needs a centrally located and highly visible facility of its own to keep
    skateboarders from illegally using and damaging city street amenities, including
    benches and stair railings. A beautiful skate plaza will help give the youth of
    Marquette a welcoming to safely skateboard.

  about: "MEET THE INSTRUCTOR:\n\n\
    My name is Jessica and I have a B.S. in Community Health Education from NMU, I am studying Yoga Therapy through YogaFit and started a Masters in Exercise Science/Kinesiology at NMU in the fall of 2012. I originally fell in love with yoga when I began practicing in 2002, I started teaching yoga full-time in 2005, and in 2009, I developed an enlightened passion for teaching prenatal yoga after the joyful birth of my amazing son. I am currently certified to teach beginning hatha yoga, prenatal/postpartum yoga and yoga for seniors through YogaFit\xC2\xAE Training Systems, the leader in mind, body, fitness education!\n\n\
    WHY PRACTICE YOGA?\n\
    There are two main reasons why yoga is more beneficial compared to conventional forms of exercise:\n\
    1. Yoga provides a WELL-ROUNDED combination of strength, endurance, balance and flexibility work.\n\
    2. Yoga offers opportunities to focus on breathing exercises that strengthen mind-body AWARENESS. \n\n\
    YOGA 4 EVERYBODY: BACK 2 BASICS: \n\
    Registration for my beginning level hatha yoga class is currently open! There are still a few spots open, so register before November 3 to secure a spot!\n\n\
    The cost for this course is just $30/individual or $50/couple and includes a yoga cd along with many take-home materials that will be of great assistance to establishing or enhancing a home yoga practice. \n\n\
    QUESTIONS?\n\
    You can reach me by phone (906.869.4883) or e-mail (jesswilso@gmail.com) at any time, you can follow my business page on Facebook for updates on current specials and events (Yoga 4 EveryBody) or you can contact me right here on CommonPlace Marquette!\n\n\

  about: |-
    The Marquette Community Garden Group was founded in 2003 when serendipity brought together several Marquette residents who all shared a love of gardening, but had insufficient yard space.
    
    With the help of Marquette Breakfast Rotary, organizational meetings occurred, resulting in a relationship with City of Marquette. MCGG drafted bylaws and rules, operates through Marquette Park and Recreation Department, and started with space in Park Cemetery. Several plots are reserved for area children groups and for dontations to food banks. The Park Cemetery garden was expanded in 2004. In 2009, the garden expanded again to Presque Isle. To date the Group offers 73 different garden beds to City of Marquette residents.
    
    Board Members: President - Ellen Weingarten, V.P. - Tara Gluski, Treasurer - Carol Maas, Secretary - Mary Martin, Outreach - Alisha Wasilewski

  about: |-
    The Little Things, which services Harrisonburg, VA & the surrounding area, was created in 2010 to provide a helping hand at affordable prices by Heather, a single mom of 2 young children who needed the flexibility to care for and nurture her boys during their busy school schedules, unexpected illnesses, and play dates while being able to support herself and boys financially.  The idea came after hearing so many other moms, dads, overworked friends, family and acquaintances express frustration at not being as productive as they wanted to be because they just ran out of time during the day to get it all done.  
    Contact Heather at The Little Things to see how she can help you today!

    These are giant outdoor paintings of Greenwood Lake through the seasons, by Greenwood Lake artists, displayed on a large wall in, you guessed it, Greenwood Lake.  The panels are portable, and have traveled to other places as envoys from the village.  Currently, we are adding Springtime to already existing Summer and Fall.  
    If you'd like to host these beautiful paintings, please get in touch with Melanie Gold.

  about: "Zumba Classes Held: MWF 8:15pm, Sat 10am at Dawn Dott Studio, 121 N. Front St., Marquette. For info call Chris at 360-9287\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Welcome to Zumba Fitness! With its hot energetic Latin and International rhythms, people feel the music, make a powerful mind-body connection, and just don't want to stop dancing because it's is so much fun!\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I'm Chris Collins, and I've had a passion for Zumba since my first class in March of 2008, and I was hooked. It's given me more balance, joy, and energy in my life, not to mention the way it's transformed my body. I became an instructor in April of 2009 because I wanted to be able to share this joy and energy I get from Zumba classes with others. I believe that positive energy is contagious, and this world needs more of it!\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I'd just love to have you come to our class! I co-teach with two awesome women, Lucy Aho and Shawna Kerekes, who are both so much fun. We have a dynamic program with a great group of students! We have even started a special program for beginners.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    C'mon-forget the \"dreadmill\", ditch your old workout, and join OUR party!! "

  about: |-
    HandsOn Ogeechee celebrated National Volunteer Week 2009, marking our third anniversary since becoming officially recognized as a HandsOn Georgia member on April 25th. At that time, we changed our name to HandsOn Southeast Georgia (SEGA) to align with state and national brand strategies and to better reflect a regional commitment to inspire, equip and mobilize people to take action that changes the world.
    
    HandsOn SEGA, a nonpartisan organization, convenes a support network of partners including volunteers, corporate citizens, educational institutions, faith-based groups, government allies, nonprofit agencies and community-based organizations to improve lives and meet critical needs. Based in Statesboro, Georgia to serve predominantly rural communities in the region, the grassroots resource center primarily connects volunteers to the causes they believe in and puts everyday people in touch with their potential to be the change.
    
    Our primary service delivery area includes counties in Southeast Georgia not otherwise covered by another HandsOn Georgia affiliate within 50 miles of Bulloch County's borders. This includes the counties of: Candler, Emanuel, Evans, Jenkins, Montgomery, Screven, Tattnall, and Toombs.

    The Mediterranean Cruise Cafe was established in 1979 through the imaginative minds of the Ansari brothers from Jerusalem, with continuous work by Jamal Ansari and his sons, Khaled and Rhami. With their strong Mediterranean heritage behind them, they have created many original delicacies from Jerusalem, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Italy, Turkey and Greece.
    
    Starting with only the freshest ingredients and many hours of dedicated work, a very nutritious, but exotic meal is yours to enjoy and remember.

  about: "DynamicShift was started Fall 2009 in Burnsville. The grassroots initiative employs positive public kindling and productive discourse to illuminate civility.  \r\n\
    \r\n\
    It encourages and mediates innovative dialogues that transcend ideologies, engage shared values and create mutually-productive change by highlighting interconnections among different community sectors.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    DynamicShift colleagues include bi-partisan elected officials as well as faith, arts, academic, business and citizen leaders from the suburban/urban corridors between the Twin Cities and Burnsville area.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    DynamicShift\xE2\x80\x99s inception was a reaction to the polarizing rhetoric of local leaders.Their conduct undermined the Burnsville Performing Arts Center, a $22 million public venue located in a mixed-income, multi-use development area. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    As a longtime citizen of Burnsville DynamicShift founder Andrea Morisette Grazzini knew the dissenting views did not represent the cooperative ethic of most citizens."

    The American Cancer Society is the nationwide community-based voluntary health organization dedicated to eliminating cancer as a major health problem by preventing cancer, saving lives, and diminishing suffering from cancer through research, education, advocacy and service.
    We save lives by helping people stay well by preventing cancer or detecting it early; helping people get well by being there for them during and after a cancer diagnosis; by finding cures through investment in groundbreaking discovery; and by fighting back by rallying lawmakers to pass laws to defeat cancer and by rallying communities worldwide to join the fight.

  about: "Our Mission\r\n\
    \r\n\
    All Saints' Church is a community of people who come together to worship God in the Episcopal tradition. We strive to provide a nurturing environment in which our members experience sharing, using and returning God's gifts. Through Jesus Christ, and in unity with the Holy Spirit, we seek renewal and growth as we worship God, serve each other and serve our wider community.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Recognizing the need to make good use of our parish home, which was received as a gift from those who came before us, we wish to maintain and enhance it for those who come after us. Our parish is a visible reminder, both to ourselves and to the community at large, of Christ's presence in our midst.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    All Saints' Episcopal Church welcomes all people who seek the love of God without regard to ability, age, color, economic circumstance, ethnic background, family configuration, gender, nationality, or sexual orientation. We promise to \"seek to serve Christ in all persons, ...strive for justice and peace among all people, and respect the dignity of every human being.\" "

  about: "We are neighbors in the Paha Sapa Park area of Burnsville, MN. Our mission is standing together for healthy kids by promoting active living and nutritious eating. We focus on connecting as a community and HAVING FUN! \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Remember what it was like when you were growing up? You left the house in the morning with mom waving goodbye and telling you to make sure you're home by supper time. You spent the day playing ball, catching frogs in the creek, playing tag at the playground or skateboarding.\r\n \r\n\
    The days of kids riding their bikes to a friend's house eight blocks away and playing outside all day long seem to have disappeared. Now our kids get most of their physical acitivity from organized sports and if we exercise, it's scheduled and often nothing more than drudgery to squeeze into our busy lives. Dinners are eaten on the run and nutrition goes right out the fast-food window. Our lives have become fragmented and frayed with everyone going in different directions rather than coming together.\r\n \r\n\
    Paha Sapa - Play It Forward is NOT another thing to add to your already packed schedule. There is nothing to register for, no fees to pay, no mandatory weekly activity to commit to. Our events are periodic and often spontaneous, with a focus on active living and/or healthy eating, connecting people in our neighborhood and having fun!\r\n \r\n\
    To support our goals, our events:\r\n \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Are fun, creative and free\r\n \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Are inclusive and accessible\r\n \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Connect families and neighbors\r\n \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Appeal to kids, parents, single people and seniors\r\n \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Are practical within our resources\r\n \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Address both eating healthy and being active\r\n \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Are sustainable by the neighborhood\r\n \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Provide multiple ways for people to \xE2\x80\x9Cplug in\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Our events draw on the skills and talents of our community members and take advantage of built-in community resources such as parks, lakes, hills and cul-de-sacs. We include a wide variety of activities \xE2\x80\x93 not just sports, but dance, kite-flying, yoga, service projects...you name it! Every participant has ownership in the events and community members are welcome and encouraged to attend activities others have planned, or plan an event of their own and invite neighbors.\r\n \r\n\
    As more people get involved with Paha Sapa - Play It Forward, we hope to see more people playing outside. Not just kids, but families and neighbors of all ages. We hope to see more acceptance of and excitement about healthy food choices. We hope for a stronger sense of community and the growth of leaders who will help continue to carry on the mission of making our kids' lives healthier.\r\n \r\n"

    We know good food so well, we grow it right here at our store. Valley Natural Foods manages two large community gardens and is creating edible orchards and eco-friendly environments out of our suburban landscape. We specialize in food that is natural--no chemicals, complicated preservatives, added antibiotics, added hormones, fillers, dyes. We carry a broad selection of organics and 90% of our meat is from Minnesota. Our deli bakes and cooks onsite and we just opened an offsite, dedicated gluten-free bakehouse (look for the Down in the Valley label)."

    Communicating puzzle? Let me take you out of the maze..
       Let me help make computer communicating fun.
    
    How can I get a photo off my camera & make it the right size to send quickly via email?
               Can I get a Facebook page easily, see what my friends are up to & let people know my latest fast?
         How can I make a neat-looking invite, send it in a snap, update info. & track who is coming?
              Which is the best way for me to find stuff online & order without someone hacking & getting my credit card?
          What is the easiest way for me to set up an email list so I can send emails to groups of people?
    	  Whatever your need, time or budget.  In your home, office or off-site.

  about: Shine is the result of my own personal journey toward a more fulfilling life. By creating a career that focuses on helping others attain their personal and professional goals, I'm actually being quite selfish... it's a "high" for me. Watching people overcome their own personal obstacles and gain the confidence to go after their dreams, it brings joy to my own life. Whether it's helping high school students with the decision of what type of college experience they would like, helping college students prep for their first big job interviews, or coaching a long-time professional with a career change, I love being a part of that process. Tell me, are you ready to shine?

  about: |-
    My name is Kristine Fountaine and I am your local Diaper Parties Consultant. Besides cloth diapers, we also carry other products like Ju-Ju-Be, Aden & Anais, Moby, Boba, and more. Please contact me for a one-on-one consultation or to book or attend a cloth diaper party. I also do baby showers- let's set up your baby registry today! 
    
    *Did you know that one child (birth to age 2) uses over 6,000 disposable diapers? 
    
    *Did you know that one disposable diaper takes around 400 YEARS to break down?
    
    Gone are the days of poking pins and plastic pants-- Book a Diaper Party today to have a hands-on learning experience with cloth diapers and receive host/ess or attendee incentives (FREE STUFF!)! Whether you're looking for the least expensive, easiest, the most eye-catching, the most practical, or the quick on-the-go solution, you have so many options! Cloth diapers are NOT what they used to be! One system may work for one family...but not the other-- a diaper party is perfect for taking a look at the diapers, touching them, and actually see what they are before you purchase them.
    
    Cloth is: 
    *Better for baby ~No harsh chemicals on babies bottom- only softness
    *Better for budget ~Save over $2,500!
    *Better for the environment ~Prevent a ton [literally!] of waste going in to the landfill!

  about: |
    For years, it had been Ryan's dream to make a sculpture of Mr. James Oliver Curwood, a write born in Owosso, Michigan, the same town Ryan was born in.  Both of these men had a great passion for the outdoors, which Ryan wanted to capture in his sculpture of Mr. Curwood.  
    
    To complete Ryan's drea, it is our goal to raise enough funds to be able to complete a life-sized cast from the sculpture model, Ryan just finished.  In the process, Mr. Curwood will be honored and Ryan's legacy will be preserved.
    
    We are working to raise the $50,000 needed to complete and install the sculpture.

  about: |-
    I am an Independent Scentsy Consultant. Scentsy products are a safe, wickless alternative to scented candles. The system involves warming wax, not burning it. The wax is food-grade and free of phthalates, and the warmers are lead-free. We have tons of different scents, and there are some other great products as well. 
    
    You can buy directly from me (in-person or online) and if you host a party you can get free products and discounts! Parties can be as simple as bringing a basket of stuff to your workplace. :) 
    
    Please check out my website for more information, and be sure to check out my facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/pages/Shanon-Ottaway-Independent-Scentsy-Consultant/248238748568729).
    
    I hope to hear from you!

  about: "Pine Island Farmer\xE2\x80\x99s Market held in Pine Island, in the main barn at W Rogowski Farm . The market venue  space is being donated by Cheryl Rogowski of the W Rogowski Farm, and endorsed by the Department of Agriculture & Markets.  Soon we will have a list posted of all the additional Sponsors that have graciously joined us this season.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Support Local & Buy Local.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    We will start off with two pre-holiday markets, November 17 and December 19, 2011. We will have some local, artisanal craft vendors geared toward holiday gifts along with the many great food items that the vendors have.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    After which, the market will be held on the last Saturday of the month, January 28, February 25 and March 31, 2012. All markets will be held from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM. Live music, chef demos, demonstrations & other activities are being planned to complement each market. The indoors site at the W.Rogowski Farm is located in the heart of the magnificent black dirt region on Glenwood Road in Pine Island.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Careful consideration is being given to the types and quantities of vendors. Sales are from local producers as the intent of the market is to provide an economic marketplace for area producers to sell their crops, baked goods and other products. The market will provide a service to the community by offering the consumer a source of quality, locally grown produce and homemade food products.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    When you visit, join us in Farmer\xE2\x80\x99s Market Roulette, a chance to win products from our vendors and sponcers, liven up the day. Simply standing on the numbered diamonds located on the floor all over the market enters you in the game.\r\n\

  about: |
    Selah is a word in the Bible which follows a poetic phrase in the scripture urging the reader to pause and reflect on what was said. Selah Yoga combines the holistic benefits of yoga with traditional Christian meditation to revitalize each participant from the inside out. 
    
    With classes ranging from the athletic, sweaty Energize class to the calming, meditative Restorative class, these classes are not only a workout, but a meditative experience. 
    
    Selah Yoga will help you pause to be refreshed both physically and spiritually.

  about: |-
    In just twelve years, Harbor of Hope Christian Church has grown from a core group of 20 people to a community of over 350.  People have come from all different walks of life - ethnically, economically, religiously, and geographically.
    
    We are a non-denominational Christian Church. We are part of an association of other "Independent Christian Churches" around the world. These 5,500+ churches with 1.5 million members voluntarily cooperate together to get stuff done, without the restrictions of religious hierarchy.  The greatest thing about a non-denominational church is bringing together people from different religious backgrounds (Protestant, Catholic, spiritually curious, and skeptics) into a fun, caring community. 
    
    So, if you're looking for a place where you are free to ask life's more difficult questions, find direction for your life from the Bible, and share a laugh or two with friends who really care, come and check out one of our services.

Why do you chose to live here? What do you want to change and what do you want to see never change? How do we pay for what is important to us? Together we will determine the future of Belmont-- the Vision.
    
    Envision Belmont strives to do this via a weekly column in the Belmont Citizen Herald, sponsoring organized neighborhood conversations, and Town wide forums known as Community Conversations.

    We are a friendly group of parents who stay-at-home, work part-time, full-time of Belmont MA and nearby towns looking to organize fun play-dates to develop social skills and many more activities for babies to 6yrs old. Hopefully we can meet at various times to make more friends.
    
    Our babies learn through love & play and we the parents are their best resource.
    
    Suggestions for new event ideas are always welcome. Members are always welcome to host an event themselves in their homes or elsewhere. Just let the organizer know.
    
    It is very helpful if you post a personal photo of yourself. This makes you easier to find you at an event. (Photos are only available to members.)
    
    We hope to see you at our next event!

    Empowering Events, is an organization that brings businesses, communities and causes together to raise awareness. We are in the process of organizing our third event, \xE2\x80\x9CTreasure our Children\xE2\x80\x9D. \xC2\xA0This event is dedicated to the children affected by Domestic Violence. Our organization feels that every person should be free from violence and the threat of violence. \xC2\xA0We aim to be a catalyst for this cause and we need your help. \xC2\xA0In our past events, we have donated a portion of the proceeds to our community partnerships such as, Safe Homes of Orange County and The Rape Crisis Program.\r\n\
    \xC2\xA0\r\n\
    Many businesses and leaders within and outside of our community are on board in support of this event. Our community is excited and eager for our upcoming event. \xC2\xA0You can be a part of that excitement by supporting with a sponsorship, partnership, donation or becoming a vendor. We are happy to acknowledge your donation on our website and at the event.\r\n\

    French Conversation welcomes franco-phones and intermediate, advanced and native French speakers. Those who feel more comfortable just listening to the conversation are also welcome. We will take articles, movies, and brief literary texts etc. as our starting points. Occasionally we will play various word and language games.
     
    We meet the second and fourth Friday of the month, from 12:30-1:30 at Harvard Neighbors, Loeb House Lower Level, 17 Quincy Street, Cambridge.

  about: |
    Our mission is to build bridges between Indian and Western cultures through the medium of theater.
    
    SETU will selectively produce plays to project the ways of life in India in a global context. It will attempt to highlight India's social, political and economic scenarios from the past and the present. India has rich and diverse tradition in drama beginning from ancient times by Sanskrit playwrights. Indian theater has found expressions in diverse forms from folk theater to musicals to modern drama forms. SETU will attempt to present some of these in the contemporary context and, in the process, create a better appreciation of India's heritage and culture

  about: "My name is Janique and my family settled in USA from the UK in 1997.  From day one we were overwhelmed by the warmth and hospitality of our neighbors, and we rapidly build a great network of friends. \n\
    Since my early childhood back in Burgundy France, I have always loved baking.  While my mother cooked the main course I prepared starters and desserts.  I introduced my \xE2\x80\x9Csavoir faire\xE2\x80\x9D to my Americans friends and they all seemed to have a preference for my Madeleines.   Over the years they became so popular that requests for them came not only from friends and neighbors, but also from schools and charity events around town. Soon I was known as the \xE2\x80\x9Cmadeleine lady\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    The year my daughter started school, I decided to pursue my passion and launched my baking company out of my kitchen.  My business took off well and I have since been baking for nearby stores, and online orders.  There is a high demand for my madeleines, but as well-equipped as my kitchen is, I have limited production capability.\n\
    I have deliberately kept my business small in order to be home for my family, but now that my son is in College and my daughter in High School, I want to take my business to the next level, meet the demand and develop my ideas.\n\
    My dream is to open a \xE2\x80\x9CMadeleine boutique\xE2\x80\x9D where my customers can choose from a large variety of flavors, and eat them on site with a cup of tea, coffee or milk, or take them to go.  I would also reserve a play area for little kids (they are my best customers). \n"
