            a1_4_2_html: CommonPlace America - the umbrella organization for CommonPlaces in towns and cities across the country - was founded in 2009 by Harvard students Peter Davis and Max Novendstern.

            q1_5_html: Why was CommonPlace created?
            a1_5_html: CommonPlace was created with the mission of using the internet to help revitalize local community in America.  We believe that web tools need not only connect us to 'friends' around the world - rather they can be used to connect us to the people who live right around us.  We aim to create a new standard for community information-sharing infrastructure that make neighborhoods better places to live in&#58; more connected, more civic and more empowered.
            q2_1_html: What's the difference between a neighborhood post and an announcement?
            a2_1_1_html: A neighborhood post is meant to be a neighborly post from an individual to their neighbors, like requests ("Can we borrow a ladder?"), offers ("I'm giving away maternity clothes"), questions ("Anyone know a good electrician?"), and personal, non-commercial updates ("We just had a baby!").
            a2_1_2_html: A community announcement is the place for publicity to the whole town and commercial announcements.  If you want to announce that you do tax preparation or are an SAT tutor, post it as a community announcement.  If you are seeking donations for your cause or volunteers for your fair, post it as a community announcement.  If you are an organization, city service or business that will posting many community announcements, consider starting a "Community Feed" so that you can post as the organization or business, and so that people can subscribe to your announcements.
            a2_1_3_html: In short, neighborhood posts are for neighbor-to-neighbor requests, offers, questions and updates while community announcements are for town-wide publicity and commercial use.
            q2_2_html: What's a Community Feed?
            a2_2_html: Any organization, business, city service or cause can create a "Community Feed" on CommonPlace.  This allows you to send out announcements and events to the community from your organization.  For example, if you are the President of the PTA, you could create a PTA "Community Feed" and then send out announcements and events which would show up as coming from the PTA, as opposed to from an individual.  In addition, people can subscribe to your community feed and thus receive your announcements and events by email.
            q2_3_html: What is my 'neighborhood' on CommonPlace?
            a2_3_html: Each town on CommonPlace is split into neighborhoods of roughly 700 residences each.  When you write a neighborhood post, it is emailed immediately to those who are in your neighborhood.  Everyone else in town will receive that post at the end of the day in a daily digest, under "Posts Around Town."  For specific information about your neighborhood's borders, email your community CommonPlace organizer at %{organizer_email}.

            a2_4_2_html: The community weekly bulletin is a compilation of all announcements posted to CommonPlace that week as well as the next two weeks of upcoming events.
            a2_4_3_html: The daily digest is an email tailored directly to you, that includes posts from around town, as well as announcements and events from the community feeds to which you have subscribed.

            q2_6_html: What about privacy?
            a2_6_1_html: CommonPlace is a closed network, meaning nothing you ever post or share on CommonPlace can be Googled-- one has to register and log in to see the information.

By associating posts with names, it ensures healthy, productive and neighborly interaction on CommonPlace.  Plus, we have already had cases of people meeting in person and saying, "Oh, wow, you must be Janet - I saw your post on CommonPlace!  Great to meet you!"
            q2_8_html: Why do I have to input my street address when I register?
