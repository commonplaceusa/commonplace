        %h3 In Order to Form a More Perfect Community
        %p Because community is the heart of Raleigh, and because our neighborhoods are made up of amazing and inspiring neighbors who love their families and want to help each other, it is time we hammer the Internet into a tool that unites rather than divides our communities.
        %p (A beautiful article about CommonPlace published in <strong>The Raleigh Creative District</strong>)
