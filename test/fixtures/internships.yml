  essay: "Over the past several years we've been able to witness the profound impact that technology can have in providing a forum for discourse and organization.  The revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia, as well as throughout the Middle East prove that social media as well as basic internet use, can spread word about events, organize demonstrations, and eventually place enough pressure on leaders to create true change.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I would love to work with an organization that provides a digital forum for communities to come together and increases connections that normally may not have been made.  I have experience working at a dynamic non-profit organization in Philadelphia, and have seen the difference that non-profits can make in the lives of people from all backgrounds.  I would be excited to put technology to use in a way that seeks to create positive community coordination.  "

    Hi, my name is Alex and I am a Masters of Management student at UBC's Sauder School of Business. My passion for the community is illustrated through my past volunteer and community work. I am currently conducting a market research study that aims to examine attitudes to renting or buying art for corporate purposes for Art Rental and Sales at the Vancouver Art Gallery. In a team of three, we collaborate with multiple stakeholders to research corporations and determine the best structure for existing Integrated Marketing Communications. 
    
    As much as I am interested in this fellowship, I am going on a European Summer Exchange program in mid June and my Masters program finishes at the end of May. This gives me a window of two weeks to be involved. However, if there is any other way for me to be involved with CommonPlace, please do not hesitate to let me know. Thank you for your time.
    
    Sincerely,
    Alex

    Hi, my name is Madeline Halpern, and against the oft-issued edict of my mother, I talk to strangers. Well, maybe "strangers" is the wrong word; perhaps it would be more accurate to say "members of my community that I have yet to meet." My community and social involvement throughout my high school career has defined a large portion of my identity. Over the past several years, one community has had a special place in my heart: my temple's youth group. For the past three years, I have been heavily involved with organizing events and membership for the youth of my temple's community, bearing ultimate responsibility for member attendance at various social events, as well as ensuring enthusiastic participation at these events. My experience in organizing these events has been a challenge at times, as instilling a sense of community within youth who may only attend meetings for the sake of college applications is quite a difficult task, but I have taken a great deal from this experience, including leadership skills that would be immensely valuable to be as a CommonPlace Community Organizing Fellow.
    
    My experience in organizing events and membership for my temple's youth group has taught me many skills that are essential for success in an organization position such as what CommonPlace is seeking for this summer. I have developed efficient communication strategies such that I can deal with people who are much more firm in their ideologies than others, such that I can (usually) bring them at least a little bit outside of their comfort zones. Additionally, I have learned how to minimize the effect of age and other demographic differences, an extremely valuable skill in working with the diverse communities that CommonPlace is attempting to bring together in an electronic manner. I believe that both of these will contribute heavily towards rallying people about the CommonPlace platform, helping to transition the community that I will be responsible for into a deeply connected network of people.

    I am completely head-over-heels in love with CommonPlace, its goals and its methods. I want to inspire and reinvigorate the local community spirit in my hometown, Howell, New Jersey. Having lived in many different neighborhoods throughout my childhood, I have experienced life in rural, urban and suburban areas. Each of these areas has had its pros and cons, but I found my heart and soul lies within the small shore town where I spent my high school years. After graduating from high school, I have been in and out of Howell in a non-consistent pattern due to my college level program's requirements, but I always make sure to have a good two months in the summer time to spend at home. However, the Howell I left in 2008 has changed drastically.
    
    Recently there has been a series of five young men from my community, of high school age, who have died due to self-destructive behavior. It has seriously perplexed me and my peers, and I ask the question - What has become of the youth culture, the culture of this community, to allow these events to occur? I am beginning to seek out an answer - with the decline of the economy, our town's social climate has undergone many changes. Community focused events are disappearing, such as the elimination of long traditions - 'Howell Day', and our yearly Fourth of July fireworks show were both cut this past year. Both of these events, though entirely socially focused, definitely played a key part in our community cohesion. Further, our town's summer day camp for our elementary children, coordinated by the Dept. of Rec., has seen budget restrictions, having to eliminate an entire day of the week, leaving the camp to run only Monday to Thursday, and shortened it from six to four weeks long. As a previous camp counselor for three years, it is sad to know that the high school aged youth of my town are losing opportunities to engage in positive mentoring relationships with our towns children. These are just a few of the recent ills facing my community, and I am nervous to see if this negative trend will continue. I hope that I will be able to influence a change in the trend in some way. I see the potential CommonPlace can have in Howell as a step in the right direction towards making a true positive change in my community.
    
    In terms of my community organizing capabilities, I have held many leadership roles within organizing efforts both on my university's campus and in the local Boston community. I believe I would be able to effectively inspire and empower the members of my community around CommonPlace - I have many connections with different networks, both on and offline, and have kept strong ties with my high school administrators and educators. In terms of goals and strategies, I hope to make connections with our town council and municipalities, through organizing those of my community members and friends who are lifelong Howell citizens. 
    
    This summer, I will be in Boston from May to June 30, then returning to Howell for July to August 16.
