  reason: "Years after experiencing ovarian cancer when her triplet daughters were only three and her newborn was two weeks old, Stephanie started the Lexington, MA chapter of the Neighbor Brigade which helps families going through a crisis.  Volunteers sign up to help chip in with small tasks and errands for the person in need.  The aim is to take the burden of tasks such as grocery shopping, preparing meals, and running errands off the shoulders of family and close friends of the person in need.  Stephanie also sits on the Town's Human Services Committee and has a master\xE2\x80\x99s degree in public policy and administration.  The Lexington chapter of the Neighbor Brigade already has 150 members and is growing.  Stephanie has created a true sense of community through the Lexington Neighbor Brigade and her contribution to our town is greatly appreciated.\n\n"

  nominee_name: Elizabeth Billings Fouhy
  nominee_email: efouhy@sch.ci.lexington.ma.us
  reason: "I am writing to nominate Elizabeth Billings Fouhy as a civic hero in Lexington. Liz has been a teacher and the director of Lexington\xE2\x80\x99s Children Place for 20 years.\n\n\
    Lexington Children\xE2\x80\x99s Place, the Lexington Public Schools (LPS) Early Childhood Program, provides evaluation services for young children from the age of 2 years 9 months to 5 years of age to determine eligibility for special education services. Since the Federal and State laws dictate that young children with special needs be serviced in the least restrictive,\xE2\x80\x9Dmost typical\xE2\x80\x9D educational setting possible, LPS has developed a range of service options for children with special needs:\n\n\
    Discrete services: Through an Individualized Education Program (IEP), LPS provides discrete OT, Speech and Language or PT services to that child at Harrington Elementary School. Special education consultation is also provided to the private school programs.\n\n\
    Integrated preschool programming: LPS has developed an integrated program model for the children with special needs who cannot be served in the area nursery schools or daycare centers. Children are educated with typically developing peers who do not have special needs. Children receive speech and language, OT, and PT services throughout their school day.\n\n\
    Full-day intensive services: This classroom is designed for children who require intensive, small group, or individual educational programming. Many of these children are on the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and need very specific teaching methods and strategies.\n\n\
    Longer-year (summer) services (program and discrete services) are provided for children who will substantially regress after an extended period of time without services.\n\n\
    In Liz\xE2\x80\x99s role as director of LCC, she is often the first person families meet when they enter Lexington Schools with a special needs child. Liz is a knowledgable, compassionate person who quickly becomes a \xE2\x80\x9Clifeline\xE2\x80\x9D for worried parents and their complicated children. Through Liz\xE2\x80\x99s strong knowledge-base, warmth and leadership, she quickly creates a strong alliance with families and guides them through the complicated world of special education. \n \n\
    In her role as director of LCC, Liz provides an essential service for the community; she represents public school education and Lexington, at it\xE2\x80\x99s finest. When I think about who would qualify to be a civic hero in Lexington, it is Liz Fouhy because of her 20 year dedication to the community, the schools, families and to our most vulnerable children of Lexington.

  nominee_name: Dr. Patricia Moyer
  nominee_email: "\"Pat Moyer\" <pat_moyer@comcast.net>,"
  reason: Since 2003 Pat Moyer has spearheaded the effort to improve the landscaping at Lexington High School.  She organized designers, who came up with plans and wholesale plant material.  With the help of her informal "board" of adult volunteers, she organized two "planting days" per year with up to 80 student helpers.  This necessitated fundraising campaigns and a yearly plant sale which supports paid student weeders and waterers over the summer.  The high school is an entirely different place thanks to her efforts.

  reason: Mary is a constant contributor to the Lexington Field and Garden Club and the Historical Society. She's a former History teacher from Lex. HS and her students still love and respect her. I doubt that there is a town event she hasn't been a part of-always operating humbly behind the scene.

  nominee_name: Pat Moyer
  nominee_email: pat_moyer@comcast.net
  reason: As a newcomer to town around 2002, Pat saw the completion of the LHS renovation project leave the school grounds an inhospitable wasteland, and decided to do something about it.  She put out a call for others to join her and organized the Lexington High School Landscaping Committee under the umbrella of the PTSA.  For 10 years Pat has kept up the group's momentum by writing grant proposals, recruiting student labor, cajoling the committee into yet another fundraiser or the DPW into delivering another truckload of loam or wood chips, and coordinating with school and town administrators.  She outworks everyone around her, her face smudged with dirt and her optimism always on display.  Key to the transformation of the LHS grounds is her organization of a summer maintenance program, where about 20 student workers supervised by Landscaping Committee members weed and water the extensive shrub and perennial beds so that the school looks well groomed when teachers and students return in the fall.

  nominee_name: The Doran family
  nominee_email: doranlex@gmail.com
  reason: |-
    I would like to nominate the DORAN FAMILY, Elaine, Guy and Sam for their generosity of time, beautification of our Statue of the Minuteman (Elaine's idea and continous planting for many years), dedication and support that they have given to different Lexington organizations for over 20 years that I have known them. Their love of Lexington's history has guided and supported their son's interest who in the past few years has provided our community with special articles on historic subjects that he has researched and have appeared in both of our local newspapers, as well as his participation in many events related to the Lexington Historical Society.
    The Doran family is such an inspiration to so many of us. Two working parents who always found time to give to others. 
    I have had the privilege to work with both of them, Elaine, Garden Club and Historical Society, Guy Lexington Historical Society, and Sam, I saw him grow and become such an accomplished young man who is greatly admired and respected in our community. Sam is only 17 years old.

  reason: Carolyn is a tireless unpaid advocate for the Lexington Interfaith Food Pantry.  As the chief co-ordinator of the pantry, I estimate that this role requires over 30 hours a week of her time to keep it open and running smoothly.  I know that weekly she manages volunteers and resources, shops, sets up and tears down.  Additional time is spent educating the community about the pantry and the needs of the clients, as well as dedicating time to  source additional resources and food supplies.  She is definitely a community hero...and has been for years.

  nominee_name: Cricket McCaffrey-Clark
  nominee_email: cricket@colonial.net
  reason: "\tChristine (Cricket) McCaffrey-Clark has been one of the most influential people in my life. She has been more then a chemistry teacher, professional mentor, and colleague of mine and in fact I consider her a role model, life mentor, and friend. Cricket was my chemistry teacher at West Boylston High School for two years in both Introductory Chemistry (1995-96) and AP Chemistry (1996-97). Cricket taught me not only topics in chemistry but how to be a good problem solver and to realize that if I put in the effort, I could enter a challenging course like AP Chemistry and succeed. She instilled a love for problem solving in me that inspired me to pursuit chemistry in college, graduate school, and now as a career. As my teacher, she was always willing to help me (and others) outside of class when needed and I also remember going to her for help in Physics even though she was not my physics teacher. Cricket has always been able to hold her students to a high standard in academics and actions. This is why she is so much more then a teacher to her students. Cricket meant so much to me in high school, that I asked her to accept my rose on senior night at my last basketball home game that my parents were unable to attend. I will never forget that night. \n\
    \tWhen I went to college at Merrimack College, I was so thankful to have had Cricket\xE2\x80\x99s lessons in problem solving. It made my transition into academics on the college level that much more smooth especially when I was burdened with time commitments to the Women\xE2\x80\x99s Basketball Team. Her teachings helped me to succeed at the college level as a chemistry major and then purse a higher degree in chemistry at Brandeis University While at Brandeis, I realized that I wanted to switch gears and teach chemistry on the high school level, so of course, I called Cricket. She took me in as an \xE2\x80\x9Cunofficial student teacher\xE2\x80\x9D on a weekly basis. This allowed me to solidify my aspirations to be a high school teacher. She mentored me on everything from what steps I needed to take to become certified to classroom skills and management. She allowed me to teach a few classes of hers and mentored me o which job offer I should take. \n\
    During my first year of teaching, I was at a high school where I was the only chemistry teacher and had little to no materials to start my new career path with. Cricket shared with me every worksheet, pacing guide, test, etc. that she had, meet with me over the summer to review my expectation sheets, and regularly mentored me over the phone on a fairly regular basis about every need I had. When the opening at CCHS came about, Cricket convinced me to apply for the position and gave me all the right reasons why I should take the job. Of course she was right. At CCHS, Cricket continues to be a great inspiration, mentor, and friend. She is the big reason why I have taken on more challenging roles then I thought I could such as teaching AP Chemistry after only teaching here for 2 years, is the inspiration behind starting up my new Organic Chemistry course, and is the guiding force to helping me become the best teacher in and out of the classroom that I can be. \n\
    There are so many selfless, inspirational actions and qualities about Cricket that I would love to share with you, but I hope that I have highlighted a few of those to give you a good sense of how excellent of a teacher Cricket is in and out of the classroom. She is truly a teacher of not just chemistry and problem solving, but of much more. \n"
