            CommonPlace is a web platform for local community engagement.
          %p
            Our technology is designed to make it really easy for neighbors and community leaders to share information about local events, neighborhood needs or community announcements with the folks who live in their town.
          %p
            CommonPlace works with communities across the country. We’d love to work with yours! If you’re interested in bringing CommonPlace to your town, contact 
            =mail_to("Organizing@CommonPlaceUSA.com", "Organizing@CommonPlaceUSA.com")
